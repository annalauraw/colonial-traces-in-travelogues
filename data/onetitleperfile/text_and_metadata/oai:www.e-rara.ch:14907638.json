That Captain sailed to the coast of Os Papuas, and ranged' it; but, not knowing that Saavedra had been there before him, he challenged the honour of discovery. He called, it New Guinea, * from the frizzled locks of the inhabitants: for the memory of Saavedra's voyage was almost lost. -f* Lopez Vaz relates, that some time about the year 1567, Lopez de Castro, governor of Peru, sent a fleet to discover certain islands in the South Sea. Alvarez de Mendanio was general. At the distance of 800 leagues, they discovered between 9° and n° of 8. latitude, some large islands; together, eighty leagues in compass. The greatest island was, according to the first finder, called Guadalcanal. Here they landed, took a town, and found small grains of gold. Pie farther fays, \" now at the time they thought of fettling these islands, Captain Drake entering the South Seas, command was instantly given, that the islands should not be settled, lest the English or other nations, who passed the slraits of Magellan for the South Sea, sliould find there any succour but from the Indians.\" J It is not impossible, that pursuant to this, the Spaniards, in their posterior charts, misplaced Solomon's islands, and cast them far east into the South Sea.

This has so far been verified by Captain Carteret's discovering a strait pass through the middle of New Britain. But, a map published by Linschooten in 1695, puts the matter beyond all doubt, as in that map the islands at the east extremity of New Guinea, are absolutely named Solomon's islands.* It is to be regretted, that Dampier, who failed to New Britain in the Roebuck 1699, had not seen Linschooten's map, published but four years before. Such a guide might have induced him to put into harbours which he did not visit, not knowing they existed : for the least additional light to a discoverer may be productive of important consequences. As Lopes: Vaz mentions gold found there, and the Spaniards unwilling the Portuguese should have any share in it, that circumstance might farther induce the former (if they were indeed induced) to misplace those islands; that these might not appear in the portion of the globe which the Pope had assigned them ; the other half having been given to the Portuguese by virtue of the famous meridian -f- of * Plate XIV. f Some fay, the first meridian is drawn through Fayal ; but the following accompanies de Pry's maps.

Lopez Vaz asserts, that' the Spaniards carried back gcki from Solomon's islands to New Spain, Schouten* and le Maire, in 1616, after leaving an island they called St. John, and the Green islands, came to the coast of New Guinea, and. sent their shallop in shore to sound. She was attacked by several canoes, whence they threw stones at the boat with slings* Next day, the 26th of June, the ship was attacked, the enemy throwing stones and darts. This they were obliged to resent*. They killed' ten of the assailants, took three more, and four canoes.. The canoes they destroyed, and ransomed two of the three prisoners for a* hog and a bunch of plantains.. Next day, they got another hog for some nails and trinkets. On the 28th, a handsome large canoe came * on board, with twetity-one persons, who admired the ship much, and brought betel nut and lime. -f- These called themselves Papuas, and did not osser to exchange the third prisoner; upon which they pus him ashore. Continuing their course westward, on the yth os July, they passed, an island called Vulcan's y no doubt, one of the burning islands in the map. On the 13th, they anchored within half a league of the maim land, in 2° 54 S. latitude j and, finding the country abound in coco nuts, sent the boat, well provided for an attack, with orders to land and get some. But such was the reception, from the arrows of the inhabitants, that sixteen being wounded, the invaders were forced, notwithstanding their muskets, to retire. * Harris's Collection, Vol. I. p. 60. f Used t-v most East Indians with the arekanut and betel leaf.

In sailing along the coast, they saw a very pleasant island, named in the map, Horn island. The crew changing its name, called itSchou- ten's island, in compliment to their commander. As the south coast of it is in Dampier's chart, left indefinite by a dotted line, I have some reason to think, the promontory of Dory may be the same land, but not sufficient evidence to ascertain it. Abel Tafman, in 1642, after sailing round New Holland, and so discovering it to be an island, returned by New Britain and New Guinea. He then passed a burning mountain, in the latitude of s° 04/ 8. and afterwards got refreshments from the island Jama, * which lies a little to the east of Moa, The natives brought him 6000 coco nuts, and 100 bags of plantanes. The sailors, in return, making knives of iron hoops, bartered these awkward instruments for those refreshments. Tafman had no quarrel with the inhabitants. They seemed, at Moa and Arimoa, to be afraid of him ; for, one of his sailors having been accidentally wounded, by an arrow from the bow of one of the natives, the man was delivered up. Captain Dam pier, in the voyage of the Roebuck, already mentioned, being on the west coast of New Guinea, bought, near an island, called by the natives Sabuda, three or four nutmegs in the shell, which did. * Plate XVI-. • b not"}, {"page_label": "Seite 17", "page_text": "X INTRODUCTION. not seem to be long gathered. This agrees with what I found at Dory. The dress of the people also near Pulo Sabuda, is exactly that worn at Dory ; the men wearing the rind of the palm-tree* and the women calicoes,. Dam pier touched no where on the coast of New Guinea* but failed; near several islands close by New Britain, Wifhart's Island, Matthias, and Squally Island ; also Slinger's Island, whence he was insulted with vollies of stones. Had he anchored behind any of these islands, which I apprehend, he might have done ; or, if he had not fired small and great shot at the inhabitants of the large bay,, where he did anchor,^ to scare them, as he owns, he might have doubtless had intercourse with them, and not been reduced to the hostility of taking, by violence,. some of their hogs. Thus the whole discovery, from impatience or fear, was frustrated. By his account of the appearance of the country, it is well inhabited and cultivated; much better than the places I visited farther west.. Captain William Funnel, 1705,* observed several islands in 0° 42' N. latitude, near the coast of New Guinea, inhabited; but by a- seemingly hostile people: which prevented all intercourse with them. He saw the coast only ata distance; and says, it appeared to him mountainous, black, and rocky. Being afterwards in distress for provisions, and unacquainted in those seas, he was, by the mask of friendship, decoyed to Amboyna, where he suffered very rough usage from the Dutch.. • Harris's Collection.

He then pasted by what he clusters in the name of the Thousand Islands; where, he fays, the inhabitants had their heads covered with thick curled wool, and were called Papuas, Some of them had a bit of stick piercing the gristle of the nose, as I remarked in a slave who was brought to Dory, to be sold. Roggewein's people landing on the island Moa, began to fell the coco nut trees ; and the Indians, who lay in ambush, deservedly let fly at them a shower of arrows. Injustice is always imprudence, and ingratitude is the worst species of injustice. The natives had, just before this invasion of their property, brought the strangers all manner of refreshments. The latter, however, perceiving Moa thinly inhabited, had fallen upon this scheme of seizing provisions; thinking, to carry off, at once, stock sufficient for the prosecution of their voyage. To this conduct they were animated by the consideration, that the arrows of the natives did them little or no hurt; whereas, the discharge of their small arms laid abundance of their entertainers on the ground. The next I can find, was Captain Carteret, who discovered, as has been said. New Britain to be divided into two parts at least; by a strait, which he names St. George's Channel. He found in Englisti Cove, near Cape St. George, the nutmeg tree; but the fruit not ripe. He had only a distant intercourse with the inhabitants.

Captain Cook sailed much about the same time to the south of New Guinea, through the Endeavour strait ; where, by his account, the land is low. He had no friendly intercourse with the inhabitants.- To this hour, I do not find, that any European has had friendly intercourse with New Britain, which is well inhabited j and since Rog- gewein, nobody we know of, has had any with New Guinea. Monsieur Sonnerat, in his Voyage a la Nouvelle Guinee, lately,published, went no farther east than the istand Gibby, * near Patany Hook, on Gilolo.. Gihby is often mentioned in the following sheets.

Mr. Padderburg imagines the Badjoos have been driven from Macassar, Java, Bantam, and Japara. They have about 700 boats, in which they live mostly on fish. He adds, they have a king to whom. they pay homage. They have a strange squeal in their voice, with a * The Author does not fay, whither he went; but this I learned from a person who deserted him, and whom I saw at Sooloo, in 1773. very"}, {"page_label": "Seite 20", "page_text": "r N T R O D U C T I' O N. very wild appearance j and, were it not for the freedom which their boats afford them of going from place to place, they would not remain, in any particular quarter, as they have a dislike to the shore. Padderburg is of opinion, they must have come either from China' or Japan, where multitudes live in boats ; and their departure from 3 that country must have been occasioned, he thinks, by the inroads of the Tartars, who conquered China,. and expelled the Badjoos, who may then have found their way amongst these islands. Those about Manado, Macassar, Borneo, and the Philippines, are a medley of different nations $ such as Chinese with long plaited, hair, Javans with' bare throats, plucked beards and whiskers, and Macassars with black shining teeth. Their religion is chiefly Chinese or Mahometan. They have in different■- parts many vessels; and, what is remarkable, their women are capable of managing those vessels even in heavy seas.

A favourable opportunity however offering, without incurring heavy ex- pences, we are unwilling to let it flip; as it is an object of the first consequence, and may, if accomplished, turn out extremely beneficial, not only to our honourable employers in particular, but also to the British nation in general. You must be sensible, as we are, how important the monopoly of spices is to the Dutch company, and the States of Holland i and equally so, how incompatible it is, as well with the dignity of our company, as their advantage, to carry on a trade in these articles surreptitiously obtained, as they annually are, from the Dutch territories, and transported to Bencoolen, Rhio, and other places in the Straits of Malacca. The Molucca's being generally understood in Europe to be solely subject to the Dutch, joined to the invariable commands of our superiors, not to interfere where any other European nation is engaged, are motives sufficient for us to reject the application that has been made, or any other that we may receive hereafter, which we may esteem to have the least tendency towards creating a controversy between the two companies.

As he has very readily consented to embark with you in a small country vessel (a Sooloo Prow) and his accounts and representations give us a latitude to hope for some favourable discoveries ; we think we should not deserve the appellation of faithful servants, if we delayed our researches into an object of the first magnitude, when it can be prosecuted with no heavy charge, and wears the prospect of terminating to the greatest national good.

The Dutch seem to claim a right to all the Molucca islands, more from the forbearance of other European nations, than from any just title. I am not certain whether the islands of Waygiou, My sol, Ba- tanta and Salwattay,, may not also be claimed by them; but I resolved, from Tuan Hadjee's report, and what I had learned of others, to go beyond those islands, as far as the coast of New Guinea, where surely the Dutch can have no pretensions. Sensible of the jealousy and watchfulness of the Dutch in the Molucca islands, near which it was necessary for me to pass on my way to New Guinea, no less than of the danger of navigating in narrow seas, in a vessel that drew much water, I preferred a small one often tons burden. In a large vessel we must have been cautious of coming near land. The crew I had (Malays chiefly) make bad sailors in square rigged vessels ; and, having never been accustomed to lie in an open road, or be in a harbour, without the indulgence of going on shore, they would not have had patience to remain on board, which even in a sloop of thirty tons, would have been necessary: and, in a vessel no larger than thirty tons, with such a crew, I must have frequently run the"}, {"page_label": "Seite 42", "page_text": "TO NEW GUINEA. 7 the risk of being wrecked, had I made free with the shore. This I was enabled to do boldly, im a boat of small burden, that rowed, and drew little water; and, when she touched the ground, which often happened, part of the crew, by jumping overboard, could push her off again; and, when in, harbour,, every body had free access to tire shore.. In a large vessel, I must have carried with me a stock of provisions, which the settlement we fitted out from, could not well afford; besides, when at places that afforded provisions, in a vessel of any size at anchor, I must have sent my boat ashore, which would be liable to insult. I have known many such things befall ships boats in Malay countries, where designing people entice the crew or commanding officers to be off their guard, by a treacherous show of civility. Commodore. Watson, in the Revenge, lost his boat going through some straits, by the island Salwatty. Many voyages have failed,, many trading country vessels have been cut off, and some wrecked,, from unexpected accidents of this kind.. The vessel I had, and which shall be hereafter described, was perfectly,' suited, in her construction and manner of working, to the crew, who were mostly Malays,, or natives, of those islands that lie east of Atcheen Head : several were Bisayans, that is, natives of the Philippines, and were christians;, some were Magindano and Molucca Mahometans, vassals and staves to Tuan Hadjee; two were from Bencoolen and'Pulo Nays, and three were Indostan sailors (lascars.)

They knew not a word os the Malay tongue, at least for many months after they embarked ; consequently, could not well quarrel with their Mahometan shipmates. However, they soon learnt to speak Malays, and at the same time they learnt how to behave towards them, that is, never to hurry or abuse them. To ensure sobriety, I carried with me very little wine, or strong liquor: my Malay crew never required any, and my two Europeans soon reconciled themselves to tea and coffee. I had one person os rank, education, and good behaviour with me, Tuan Hadjee. He had several of his own country with him, his slaves and vassals, for whom he drew pay ; and who often took liberties, against which I found it imprudent to remonstrate. This person had made a pilgrimage to Mecca. He was a relation of the Sultan of Bat- chian, and was well rewarded before he came on board, by Mr. Herbert, who made him a captain of Buggtsses, having besides great expectations. I knew I could depend on his fidelity; and that he would be of great service in the voyage, having formerly been at Dory harbour, on the coast of New Guinea. Without such a person 1 should have been in danger from a Malay crew ; especially as 1 had property on board to bear the expence of the voyage, victualling, 6cc. I made my account from the beginning, that wherever I found people, I should there find provisions; and, I thank God, we were not disappointed. The vessel, in which I made the voyage, was called the Tartar-Galley. She was a Sooloo boat, or prow, about ten tons burthen. Her keel was"}, {"page_label": "Seite 44", "page_text": "TO NEW GUINEA. 9 was tw&ffty-five feet long,' and ihe had L kind of gallery built on each fide, from diem to diem, projecting about thirty inches over each ■gunnel. Here fat the rowers, sometimes twenty in number. She overhung so much forward and abaft, that slie was forty feet long. Her draft of water was generally three foot and a half. We had four swivel guns, two blunderbusses, ten muskets, and six pistols, beside lances, bows and arrows. She had for a mast an artillery triangle * (gin or tripod) made of three stout bamboos, which could be struck with the greatest ease by three men. On this was hoisted a large four cornered fail, called by the Malays, lyre tanjong (pointed fail), because the upper corner appears sharp or pointed. I fixed to her a foremast close forward, and a bowsprit,- and gave her a lateen, or three cornered foresail. I also gave her a lateen mizen ; but, when it blew fresh, I took down the lyre tanjong from the tripod mast, as it was a very large fail, and put in its place a lateen fail. The fails then resembled those of the galleys in the Mediterranean. One very great advantage attends the lyre tanjong, which is this; that when the wind freshens, it can, without lowering, be instantly diminished or made smaller, by easing or slacking the sheet, and at the fame time winding up the sail, by two men turning the cross bar or winch that is fixed to the inner end of the boom, and which spreads the lower part of the fail. By * A great improvement might be made in navigation by means of the tripod mast. It would be a very good substitute for a mizen mast to cruizers ; because, when struck, they would appear at a distance like brigs, and deceive an enemy.

She belonged to the Rajah of the island ; and I apprehend from the hurry they were in, when we first appeared, that they were a little afraid. When we were at anchor, the westermoft part of the island bore W. by S. two miles distant, and the eastermost part of a reef, that lay off the said west part of the island, bore 5. by W. one mile distant. This formed a good road, if not a harbour ; being shut in from the eastern swell, by a reef of rocks: two small islands bearing at the fame time, E. by S. three leagues distant, called the Mambalu islands, in Mr. Dalrymple's maps.

I therefore immediately got under way, rowed and sailed towards Sooloo. At midnight could fee lights ashore, in the town of Bowang, which is the chief town of Sooloo. As Pangatarran abounds in Coco nuts, I laid in a good stock. On Thursday the 17th, I anchored in Sooloo road, just before fun rife. I found riding here the Antelope, Captain Smith, a ship belonging to the Honourable Company, and only one Molucca Prow, beside many small prows and vessels belonging to the Sooloos. As I anchored close to the Molucca prow, the Noquedah came on board, and informed me, that the other prow, after disposing of her cargoe, had failed; he likewise told us, that he had fold, or at least bargained for his nutmegs with the Sultan : therefore he declined going to Balambangan. He was very glad to fee Tuan Hadjee. As I was anxious to fee this eastern vessel, I went on board ; I found her about thirty tons burthen, high built, and fitted with the tripod mast, and lyre tanjong. I bought from one of the crew, about twenty pounds of very good mace for a red handkerchief: I also bought some sago cakes. The people belonging to this prow were exceeding civil, and lent me their canoe (sampan) to fetch water. Captain Smith perceiving I was without a boat, very politely sent his to attend me; in which, after visiting him, Tuan Hadjee and I went on shore, and paid our respects to Mr. Corbet, the English resident,"}, {"page_label": "Seite 54", "page_text": "TO NEW GUINEA. *9 dent, who received me with great civility, and entertained me at his >774- x>uv,cuiuef. house.

The horses accustomed to this, trot very fast. These two ladies were remarkably handsome, and were reckoned fair ; which they certainly were by comparison.

On Monday the 28th, we had moderate weather, and in the night we rowed a good deal. I found Tuan Hadjee in high spirits, cheering up the rowers with a certain Tactic song, to which a man beat time with two brass timbrels. This song was in the Mindano tongue, and is much used by Mangaio boats, not only to amuse and cheer up the mind, but to give vigour to their motions in rowing. This I encouraged, that we might soon get past the Dutch settlements of Ternate and Tidore. I also gave each man a red handkerchief for their encouragement. The current was much in our favour.

The Dutch, in order to compensate their allowing the Sultan no power to interfere with their plan of curbing all kind of free and open trade (not only with Magindano and other more distant parts, but with any adjacent country) show him great attention and respect, because, if this were not closely watched, and put under severe restrictions, it would soon affect their monopoly of the clove and nutmeg, the former of which they permit to be cultivated at Amboyna, and the latter at Banda only. In order to effect this, or rather to approximate towards it, the Dutch, with great wisdom, discourage the inhabitants of Gilolo from trading with Celebes, Bouro, Ooby, Ceram, Mysol, Salwatty, and other parts. Such prows or vessels, as clear out regularly for those islands, with grain, sago, or other articles permitted, must have a pass, which is not only expensive, but got with difficulty, and must be renewed every voyage. This strictness is to prevent their trading in spices, growing in abundance, in many retired spots of the large and woody island of Gilolo. They are generally cut down in places of easy access, and near the sea but what may be thus destroyed, is not, perhaps, the hundredth part of the trees, producing this precious fruit.

Possibly the chief's domestics might inform him of many more such ipots at hand j but they are too wife to fay much on so delicate a subject. A Dutch governor of Ternate, once travelling on the main of Gilolo, stopped at-a Malay village, where he saw a long notched stick made of the clove tree.* The inhabitants (whose.houses, as in Other Malay countries, are built on stilts or posts, about five or six foot from the ground) use such notched sticks as ladders to ascend by, about the bigness of a man's leg. Unfortunately, however, for the poor people of the village, this stick or ladder was longer than sufficient to mount to any of their houses; and being of the clove tree, they were deemed guilty of having some how dealt in that forbidden fruit. The Dutch are severe upon those occasions. Tuan Hadjee told me, the Sultan of Batchian applies frequently to the governor of Ternate for spices, to show his zeal, though they grow in abundance near his house; spices being regularly sent to Ternate by the annual ssiip from Batavia. * The clove tree I neVer saw: but on the island Tappa I saw a nutmeg tree, and gathered the unripe fruit, which exactly resembles our peach.

The inhabitants of the Moluccas in particular, not being able to maintain their independence against Europeans, (whatever they did before history gives an account of them) have had their country continually in a state of war, as the monopoly of the clove and nutmeg has been successively a subject of contention between the Portugueze, Spaniards, and Dutch.

At the mouth of the harbour we met a boat with four Papua men, and two women, which I hired to tow us out, there being little wind, and we therefore rowing at the fame time. I observed the two women plied their paddles more than the men : their hire was a red handkerchief.

From this circumstance, I judge it to be ra- ,J ther barren in general; tho' the valley where I landed, and which appears, in the view, had a rich foil, with a most luxuriant vegetation; and that part of the island, on the north side of the bay, is covered with tall timber trees; whereas, the trees on those other parts that appear in the view, to the south west, are rather dwarfish. I was told that a good many sago trees grew upon it. This island is not inhabited, tho' travellers by water, in their way from Patany-hook, on the island Gilolo, and from the island Gibby to Waygiou, often put into the bay where I did, to pass the night, and sometimes stay there a fishing for several days; the Island Gag being about half way betwixt Gibby and Waygiou, and almost in the tract. To go into the bay, fend first a boat to lie upon the spots of coral rocks, that are on each hand in the entrance, which is sufficiently broad. These rocks ffiow themselves by their bright colour under water; but never above water, even at the lowest. Off Pulo Gag lie several banks, with ten and twenty fathom depth, sandy ground : on those banks is good fishing. A little after noon, as I have said, Tuan Hadjee returned on board in the fame boat that carried him from Gag; he brought captain Ma- reca along with him, who was to be our linguist to New Guinea.

After sunset, we arrived at Tomoguy ifland, and passing southward, anchored to the eastward of it, in eighteen fathoms muddy ground, pretty close to shore : it was then near eight o'clock, and very dark. On the Papua man's going astiore, I rewarded him handsomely for the use of his boat. On Wednesday the 14th, in the morning it began to blow at north east; being a lee shore and very steep, we rode for some time in great danger. We dragged our grapnel from rhe mud soundings, but it luckily hooked the coral rocks, and held fast, while the sea broke under our stern. I could not but be vexed Captain Mareca- had brought us to an anchor in so had a place, when many fase harbours were near; and the darkness, when we anchored the night before, prevented my seeing the badness of our berth. About noon, when the gale had moderated a little, Captain Mareca came to us in a corocoro, with ten men and paddles. They presently carried out a wooden anchor, and rattan cable, which by floating, made an excellent warp; they also 'towed us, and we got out of our danger.

I had not been ashore.at Tomoguy$. and, from the danger I had experienced near it, I imagined we could not there do our business with safety. I therefore proposed to haul ashore, where we were. To this Tuan Hadjee objected, as did most of the people that belonged to him : so I did not insist upon it. About noon, Captain Mareca came on board in the corocoro that' had so greatly assisted us yesterday. He said, we might haul ashore at high water, close to his house, the vessel being previously lightened, to enable her to stoat over the coral rocks. To this I consented : so we weighed, and rowed back to Tomoguy, Captain Marcca's corocoro towing us at the fame time.

They asked how I would have him punished; I replied, as the robbery was committed ashore, they might punish him their own way. The fellow, who was a Papua CofFre, did not seem mueh ashamed. I suspected a trick at the bottom, which made me aware of indulging resentment, I was told they did nothing to him. On the 27th, the former part of the day we had variable winds, with rain; the latter part easterly winds. About noon arrived a corocoro from Batchian, with two officers, one of them (Tuan Bobo) the person sent to me by the Sultan of Batchian, at Bistbry harbour, as has been related ; the other called Tuan Assahan.

I instantly found out the man, who had got his shield in his hand, his lance, bows and arrows, and was preparing to set off in his boat,, as on a journey; at the fame time, he seemed to be very much displeased, and spoke angrily. I took him by the hand, and, pointing to the mangled anchor, laughed, saying, it would do very well. With much difficulty,I got him into my house, where I appeased his wrath, and gave him about ten-times-its value. Immediately after this, finding the Batchian officers did not come to breakfast as usual, I went to them. They looked very grave, and had all their people ready as if to lanch their corocoro, that was- hauled up, on hearing the anchor carpenter make a noise, which they left me to allay. A little while after this, they came to my house to breakfast. Some days before, I had presented the carpenter's father, whose boat carried Tuan Hadjee from Gag to Tonaoguy, with a half worn scarlet waistcoat, and a fathom of new scarlet broad cloth. The father contributed much to appease his son's wrath; but, though I never could learn the truth, I suspected the man set on to. impose, or perhaps to pick a quarrel: all that day, therefore, I went with loaded pistols, and kept others armed also. About eleven, A. M. the Patany and Gibby men came to wait on me. I treated them with a dish of tea, and gave each some tea and sugar candy, put up in paper; which they accepted with a good grace.

The inhabitants of the small part of the Molucca islands, I had hitherto seen, were os two sorts, viz. the long hair d Moors, of a copper colour, like Malays in every respect ; and the mopheaded Papuas. These Papuas inhabit not only New Guinea, but the inland parts of most of the Moluccas; and those we saw at Tomoguy came mostly from the island Waygiou, which lay near it. The Moors had generally in their boats a few Papuas as slaves. The sago bread already mentioned, and which they make delicately at Batchian, is called by those who speak Malays, Roti Papua (Papua Bread). They fay the Papuas introduced the art of baking it amongst the Mahometans, who came to the Moluccas from parts farther west. Many of the Papuas turn Muslulmen, and then cut off their bushy locks, or at least comb them down as straight as they can. The person who carried Tuan Hadjee from Gag to Tomoguy was a proselyte of this kind, and was called Hujamat, a very civil man. His son the carpenter was a savage indeed, and wore his bushy locks.

When I had got under way, the other corocoro being lest at anchor, the Banguey approached, and one Mapalla, (son to a head man of Ceram) who belonged to her, cried out, that if the Batchian officers did not go with me, he would not.

The contents of the Sultan of Batchian's letter to him,., he always told me, were, that his officers and corocoro should accompany me whithersover I went, and that he (Tuan Hadjee) was to inforce these orders.

My pigeons grew tame, and eat Indian corn, called Jaggon. They strike hard with their wings, on which is a kind of horn. One of the three escaped at Dory harbour, the other two I carried to Mindano, where they died. Some Papua people brought me land crabs, shaped like lobsters; their claws exactly the fame, but much stronger; and their bodies not so large; they are called Oodang. I was told they climb trees, and.eat the fruit. Whilst I lay at Tomoguy, Captain Mareca was breaking sugar canes, by putting them in a press, and driving wedges. The juice thus extracted is boiled into a syrup for use. I filled a liquor case with the juice, which in a little time became good vinegar. The Mahometans here, live mostly upon fish and sago bread. Sometimes they mix a coco nut rasped down, with the sago flour ; and, putting this into a thin Chinese iron pan, they keep stirring the mixture on the fire, and eat it warm.

There being many boys and girls about us, as we fat at that part of the common hall, that goes upon the outer stage of the tenement, I separated some of the plantains from the bunch, and distributed to the children. When I had thus given away about one half, they would not permit me to part with any more; so the remainder I carried on board. I could, not help taking notice that the children did not snatch, or seem too eager to receive, but waited patiently, and modestly accepted of what I offered, lifting their hands to- their heads. The batehelors, if courting, come freely to the common; hall, and fit down by their sweethearts. The old ones at a distance, are then said often to call out, well, are you agreed ? If they agree before witnesses, they kill a cock, which-is procured with difficulty, and then it is a marriage. Their cabins are miserably furnished ; a mar er two, a fire place, an earthen pot, with perhaps a china plate or b ison, and some sago flour. As they cook in each cabin; and have no chimney, the smoke issues at every part of the roof: at a distance the' whole roof seems to smoke.

They allowed that to the eastward, at a place called Omberpon and Mandamy, were many nutmegs gathered, but I could not learn what was done with them, or to whom they were fold. Sometime before this, I had a steed Tuan Hadjee and Tuan Bussora, what they thought of going farther down the coast. They both objected to it, as they likewise did to making any inland incursion, to visit the Haraforas houses. The Papua people also <3id not seem willing that we should have any intercourse with the Haraforas, who, I believe, are some how kept under, or at least kept in ignorance by the Papuas. When I asked any of the men of Dory, why they had no gardens of plantains and kalavanfas, which two articles they were continually bringing from the Haraforas; 1 learnt, after many interrogatories, that the Haraforas supply them with these articles, and that the Papua people do not give goods for these necessaries every time they fetch them ; but that an ax or a chopping knife given once to a Hara- fora man, makes his lands or his labour subject to an eternal tax, of something or other for its use. Such is the value of iron ; and a little way farther east, I was told they often used stone axes, having no iron at all. If a Ilarasora loses the instrument so advanced to him, he is still subject to the tax; but, if he breaks it, or wears it to the back, the Papua man is obliged to give him a new one, or the tax ceases.

Being ready to go from Dory over to the island of Manaswary, where I proposed to stay a day before I sailed for good, and the people of the village, close to which I had lain, seeing our motions, I suddenly perceived, what 1 imagined, to be a distrust of us, as few children were to be seen about the Papua tenement that day: whereas, heretofore, they used to come every day on board of us, with fruit, fish, &c. to sell.

With him came many boys and women, and two men from Dory, who brought us fish, plantains, kalavanfas, &c. which were purchased from them as usual; all jealousies being removed last night. The promontory of Dory, the sea coast of which extends about fourteen leagues, is of middling height t the grounds everywhere ascend gradually. It may be said, like Malay countries in general, to be covered with wood ; but it differs in one respect : there being no underwood, it is very easy travelling under the shade of lofty trees. The country abounds with small fresh water rivulets; here and there is very good grafs, but in no large tracts, that I saw. It is very temperate, being so near the high mountains of Arfak, where the clouds seem always to settle, so that it is by far the best country hitherto visited oa the voyage. What I shall now say of the coast of New Guinea, to the eastward of Dory, and of the islands off the coast, is from the information not only of the Moodo of Aiou, but of some of the old men at Dory. From Dory I could not see Schoutens island, which I was told lay to the northward, consequently there must be a wide passage between it and the main; a passage however not very obvious in the map of this coast, accompanying Dampier's voyage in the Roebuck, in 1699.* Captain Dampier saw Schoutens island, and coasted its north side, * Plate XIV. which"}, {"page_label": "Seite 163", "page_text": "us A VOYAGE 1 775* which, as I have said, abounds with kalavanfas, and is full of inhabt- February w-v-tants.

From Saba aud Sao are brought large, red loories, also black ones. Farther, in a south east direction, lies the island of Padado, as large, as Aiou Baba; also, the island of Awak, each under its particular Rajah.

I have been told that the inhabitants of Ceram carry iron and other goods up this inlet, and trade with the inhabitants of the north coast, for Missoy bark. They are deemed also to speak different languages : but I could learn nothing of the coast east of Waropine. As to the character of the inhabitants of those places, east of where we lay, I have the greatest reason to think it was fierce and hostile, that they are numerous, and have a vast many prows t at the fame time, they are said to deal honestly with the Chinese, who trade with them, and advance them goods for several months before the returns are made. They trim and adorn their hair, but bore the nose, and wear earings like the mop headed people of Dory.

The above intelligence is the best I could procure. Those who gave it, not having the true idea of a harbour, and sometimes thinking that place deserving the name, into which a boat of theirs could go, excuse me from depending on their accounts. In the names and distances, reckoning by days, they could not so well be mistaken ; and I have the greatest reason to believe, they answered my questions, not only with sincerity, but as well as they could. During my stay here, Tuan Bussora daily supplied us with small fish, like sprats, he being very expert in casting the net: which fish broiled, with fresh baked sago bread, and a dish of tea, were our breakfast. We seldom ate in the middle of the day ; but had always, about noon, a dish of tea, coffee, or chocolate, and sometimes a young coco nut. At sunset we regularly boiled the pot, stewing whatever we had j sometimes greens and roots only, but always mixed with the emulsion or milk of a full grown coco nut, rasped down.

At Linty, I learnt from the gentlemen who had entertained us, that the birds of paradise come at certain seasons, in flocks, from the eastward, or from New Guinea; that, settling upon trees, they are caught with bird lime, then their bodies are dried with the feathers on, as we fee them in Europe. Here follows Valentine's account of the birds of paradise.* The Portuguese first found these birds on the ifland of Gilolo, the Papua islands, and on New Guinea; and they were known by the name of pajjaros da sol, i. e. birds of the fun. The inhabitants of Ternate call them manuco dewata , the bird of God, whence the name of manuco diata is derived, used by some naturalists, (Edwards f. iio. -Margrav. Brasil. 207-Rai. Syn. av. 21. n. 7.-Brits, sv. 2. p. J 30. seq. and Mr. de BufFon himself adopts the name of manucode). Fabulous accounts mentioned that this bird had no legs; and was constantly on the wing, in the air, on which it lived: in confirmation of which, the legs of these birds were cut off, when offered to sale. But the inhabitants of Aroo, who resort yearly to Banda, undeceived the Dutch, and freed them from these prejudices. Another reason for cutting off the legs is, that the birds are found to be more easily preserved without them; beside, that the Moors wanted the birds without legs, in order to put them in their mock fights, on their helmets, as ornaments. The inhabitants of Aroo, however, have brought the birds with legs these seventy or eighty years; and Pigasetta , shipmate of Ferdinand Magelhaens, proved about the year 1525, an eye witness, that they were not without legs. However, the peculiar * Vol. III. p. 306, 313. length"}, {"page_label": "Seite 194", "page_text": "TO NEW GUINEA. length and structure of their scapular feathers, hinders them from fettling in high winds, on trees j and, when they are thrown on the ground by those winds, they cannot, of themselves, get again on the wing. If taken by the natives, they are immediately killed, as their focd is not known, and as they defend themselves with amazing courage and formidable bills. There are about six species of birds of Paradise, namely: 1. The great bird of Paradise from Aroo. 2. The little bird of Paradise from Papua. 3. 4. Two different birds of Paradise, which are black. 5. The white bird of Paradise. 6. The unknown black bird os Paradise. 7. And the little king's bird, which may rank among them. 1. The largest bird of Paradise, is commonly two foot four inches in length. The head is small, the bill hard and long, of a pale colour. The head, and back of the neck, is lemon coloured, about its little eyes black ; about the neck the bird is of the brightest glossy emerald greeD, and soft like velvet; as is the breast, which is black, or wolf- coloured, (gris de loup, wolfs-geel). The wings are large and chefnut. The back part of the body is covered with long, straight, narrow feathers, of a pale brown colour, similar to the plumes of the ostrich. These feathers are spread, when the bird is on the wing; which is the cause, that he can keep very long in the air. On both sides of the belly are two tufts of stiff and shorter feathers, of a golden yellow, and shining. From the rump, proceed two long stiff shafts, which are feathered on their extremities. Several other birds of these"}, {"page_label": "Seite 195", "page_text": "2z6 1775 - March. A VOYAGE these countries have those long feathers, for instance, the Amboyna arrow tail (Pylstaart), the kingfisher, or Sariwak, and one fort of the perrokeets from Papua. Its size is not much above that of a blackbird. The legs are low, with four strong toes. The Tefnate people call them Burong Papua or Papua birds, sometimes Manuco de-wata, and likewise Sojsu or Sioff'u. The Amboyna natives call them Manu-key-aroo , the bird of the islands. Key and Aroo ; because the natives of the two last islands bring them for sale to Panda and Amboyna. At Aroo the p'eople call them Fanaan . Properly these birds are not found in Key, which is fifty Dutch miles east of Panda; but they are found at the Aroo istands, (lying fifteen Dutch miles farther east than Key) during the westerly or dry monsoon; and they return to New Guinea, as soon as the easterly or wet monsoon sets in. They come always in a flock of thirty or forty, and are led by a bird, which the inhabitants of Aroo call the King, distinct from the little kings bird. This leader is black, with red spots, and constantly flies higher than the rest of the flock, which never forsake him, but settle as soon as he settles: a circumstance which becomes their ruin, when their king lights on the ground; whence they are not able to rife, on account of the singular structure and disposition of their plumage. They are likewise unable to fly with the wind, which would ruin their loose plumage; but take their flight constantly against it, cautious not to venture out in hard blowing weather, a strong gale frequently obliging them to come to the ground. During their flight, they cry like starlings. Their note, however, approaches more to the croaking of ravens ; which is heard very plainly when they are in distress, from a fresh gale blowing in the back of their plumage. In Aroo, these birds settle on the highest trees; especially on a species of small leaved"}, {"page_label": "Seite 196", "page_text": "TO NEW GUINEA.

The natives catch them with birdlime, and in nooses, or shoot them with blunt arrows; but, though some are still alive, when they fall into their hands, the catchers kill them immediately; and often cut \"their legs off, draw the entrails, dry and fumigate them with sulphur or smoke only, and sell them at Banda for half a rix-dollar; whereas, at Aroo, one of these birds may be bought for a spike nail, or a piece of old iron. The Dutch ihips, voyaging between New Guinea and Aroo, (which arc at the distance of eighteen or twenty Dutch miles) frequently fee flocks of birds of Paradise flying from the one land to the other, against the wind. In case the birds find the wind become too powerful, they fly straight up into the air, till they reach the region, where the effects of the wind are not so strongly felt; and then continue their flight. The Moors use these birds as ornamental crests on their helmets, in war, and in their various mock fights. Sometimes they tie a bird, or part of it, to their swords. During the east monsoon, the tails of the birds are moulted ; and, for four months of the western monsoon, they have tails, according to the testimony of the people of Aroo. 2. The smaller bird of Paradise from Papua, is about twenty inches long. His beak is lead coloured, and paler at the point. The eyes small, and enclosed in black about the neck : he is green like an emerald. The head and back of the neck are of a dirty yellow, the back of a greyish yellow; the breast and belly of a dusky colour; the wings small, and chesnut coloured.

Formerly this bird was thought to be found on Gilolo or Halamahera, and the neighbouring islands, to the south and 8. E. but at this day it is known to be found only on the Papua islands. These islands extend from the south end of Gilolo, and the north coast of Ceram, to the west end of New Guinea. The largest of them are, the island of Mejfowal (which lies to the north of Ceram), and Salawatti or Salawat, whose situation is nearest to Sergbile (an island or district of New Guinea) which, in the old Portuguese charts, is wrongly called Ceram, and separated from.New Guinea. They roost on the highest trees of the mountainous part, whence they are killed with blunt arrows, by the natives of Mejfowal. Others fay, the natives infect with cocc.u~ H indict the water which the birds are to drink ; and that, so stupefied, they are caught with the hand. The birds love to feed on the fruit of the T'foampedœb tree, which they pierce with their bills, and out of which they extract the kernel.

The large black bird of paradise is brought without wings or legs for sale; so that of this species it is difficult to give an exact description. Its figure, when stuffed, is narrow and round, but stretched in length to the extent of four spans. The plumage on the neck, head, and belly, is black and velvet like, with a hue of purple and gold, which appears very strong. The bill is blackiffi, and one inch in length. On both sides are two bunches of feathers, which have the appearance of wings, although they be very different ; the wings being cut off by the na- . lives. This plumage is soft, broad, similar to peacocks feathers, with a glorious gloss, and greenish hue, and all bent upwards j which Valentyn thinks occasioned by the birds being kept in hollow bamboo reeds. The feathers of the tail are of unequal length ; those next to the belly are narrow, like hair; the two uppermost are much longer, and pointed; those immediately under them, are above a span and a half longer than the upper ones : they are stiff, on both sides fringed with a plumage, like hair; black above, but glossy below. Birds of this kind are brought from no other place, than that part of New Guinea called Serghile ; its inhabitants carrying them to Salawat, in hollow tubes of bamboo, dried upon a round long stick, in the smoke, and selling them for small hatchets or coarse cloth. The Papuas call this species Shag-awa , and likewise the birds of Paradise of Serghile : in Ternate and Tidore it is known by the name of Sojfoo-kokotoo - the black bird of Paradise. Serghile is the northermost part of New Guinea, tapering to a point, immediately behind, or to the east- T 2 ward"}, {"page_label": "Seite 199", "page_text": "j 4 ° A V O Y A G E *775- ward of Gttolo, and the Papua Ulands ; so that the point trends north- March. ^ 1 1 4. Besides the large black bird of Paradise, there is still another fort, whose plumage is equal in length, but thinner in body, black above, and without any remarkable gloss ; not having those shining peacock feathers, which are found on the greater species. This wants likewise the three long pointed feathers of the tail, belonging to the larger black species of the bird of Paradise. The Alfoories, or inhabitants of the mountains in Mejfowah. shoot those birds, and fell them to the people of Tidore. 5. The white bird of Paradise is the most rare, having two species;, one quite white, and the other black and white. The first fort is very rare, and in form like the bird of Paradise from Papua. The second has the forepart black, and the back part white; with twelve crooked wiry shafts, which are almost naked, though in some places covered with hairs. This species is very scarce, and only got by means of the people of Tidore, since it is found on the Papua islands; especially on Waygehoo :* called also Wadjoa or Wardjoo. Others are of opinion, that it is brought thither from Sergbile, on New Guinea. 6. In the year 1689, a new species of the black bird of Paradise was seen in Amboyna, carried hither from Mejfowal , only one foot in length, with a fine purple hue, a small head, and straight bill. As on the other birds of Paradise, on its back, near the wings, are'feathers of * Waygiou.-On Mysol, besides the common bird of paradise wish feet, I got a black bird, with a very long tail, and without wings ; also, some small birds, with wiry shafts in their tails, and a most beautiful plumage: they are in the Museum of Lady James. a purple"}, {"page_label": "Seite 200", "page_text": "TO NEW G U I N E A. 141 a purple and blue colour} but under the wings and over all the bell/, they are yellow coloured, as in the common fort: on the back of the w *'v- neck they are mouse coloured, mixed with green. • It is remarkable in this species, that there are before the wings two roundish' tufts of feathers, which are green edged, and may be moved at pleasure, by the bird, like wings. Instead of tail, - he has twelve or thirteen black naked wirelike shafts, hanging promiscuously like feathers. His strong legs have sliarp claws: his head is remarkably small z the eyes are likewise small, and surrounded by black.- 7. The last species is the King's Bird-, some reckon it among the birds of paradise j but, according to Valentyn, - it is entirely different. The late Linneus, as well as Count Buffon, reckon the King's bird among the birds of paradise j as it has, in general, all the characters of the bill, and the plumage common to all the kinds, known by the name of the bird of paradise. This bird is about seven inches long, and somewhat -larger than a tit-mouse. Its head and eyes are small, the bill straight, the eyes included in circles of black plumage; the crown of the head is fire coloured, the back of the neck blood coloured, the neck and breast of a chefnut colour, with a dark ring of the brightest emerald green. Its wings are in proportion strong, and the quill feathers dark; with red shining plumes, spots, and stripes. The tail is straight, short, and brown. Two long, naked, black shafts project front the rump, at least, a hand breadth beyond the tail; having at their extremities, femilunar, twisted plumage, of the most glaring green colour above, and dusky below. The belly is white and green sprinkled \""}, {"page_label": "Seite 201", "page_text": "A V O Y A G E sprinkled, and on each side is a tuft oslong plumage, feathered with a broad margin; being on one side green, and on the other dusky.

I This bird associates not with any other of the birds of paradise ; but silts solitary From bulh to busti, wherever he sees red berries, without ever getting on tall trees. At Aroo the bird is called Wowi, Wowi ; in the Papua isiands Sop- clo-o j and by the Dutch King's Bird. It is chiefly brought from Aroo Sep do-o ; and especially from JVodjir, a well known village there. The people of Aroo do not know its nest; but suppose it to come over from New Guinea , where it breeds ; and stays at Aroo only during the western or dry monsoon. It is taken in stings of gumatiy; or, with birdlime, prepared from the juice of sukkom (bread fruit, artocarpus com- munis . Forst. Nov. Gen.) then cleared and dried ; and fold at Banda.

I was assured that neither was produced on that island; but that cloves grew on some part of Ceram, the high mountains of which were to day plainly to be seen; that the clove grew also on the island of Ouby, which we had more than once been in sight of; and that on Ouby lived many runaway slaves and others, from Ternate, and elsewhere, who would have no communication with strangers, except some Buggefs prows whom they could trust, and to whom they were said to sell cloves, the produce of the island. This account of Ouby agreed with that I had received from Tuan Hadjee and the Batchian officers; Ouby being claimed by Batchian : but the Snltan makes no farther use of it, than fishing for pearls on its coasts, where no doubt any stranger may do the fame. The Dutch have a small fort on the west side of Ouby, and keep there fast failing corocoros always ready, to carry advice of whatever happens remarkable. When I was plying for many days, as has been related, oss Pulo Pifang, I asked Tuan Hadjee's opinion about standing on with our starboard tacks, and fetching Ouby, where, under the lee of the island, we could row up along shore. His answer was, that we should certainly be discovered, that advice would he instantly sent to Am- boyna, and the island Bouro, by small prows, and then we should be way-laid by armed corocoros, of which Amboyna always keeps many in readiness. Here, in Ef-be harbour, we were not above fifty leagues from Amboyna; but we trusted to the fidelity of those we were a- mongst, that no advice os us would be sent to the Dutch, to whom they did not seem to be warmly affected, as they informed us of many severities, and even robberies committed by their cruising panchallangs and"}, {"page_label": "Seite 206", "page_text": "T O N E W G U I N E A. 145 and corocoros j nor concealed the Papua people offending in their turn, with their bows and arrows.

I also paid my respects to the lady, and made her a present. She was a well-looking woman, and had three female attendants. She presented Tuan Hadjee with a small corocoro; and from him I learnt the following account of her lord. Some time about the year 1770, a number of Papua boats from New Guinea, the islands Aroo, Salwatty, and Mysol, near the time os the vernal equinox, when the seas are generally smooth, assembled, to the number of more than a hundred, and sailed up the strait of Pa- tientia, which divides Batchian from Gilolo.

However, the Rajah of Salwatty staid behind; but neither he, nor any of his people, did any mischief. The Dutch, willing to get the Rajah into their power, fell on the following stratagem. They sent a messenger to him with a paper, signed and sealed by the governor of Ternate, telling him, it was a pardon and remislion of his sal la (offence) for having come with an armed force into the Dutch territories; and that he, in particular, U 2 ' 775 - Marcli. was"}, {"page_label": "Seite 209", "page_text": "A VOYAGE 148 Mulch vvas More lucky than the other Papua chiefs, who had returned home c-■N'\"-without such a formal absolution. At the same time, he was invited. to come and fee Ternate, where the governor would do him all kind of honour suitable to his rank; and in cafe he should fancy any thing in the Company's warehouses, he had a bag of dollars presented him- This was the bait. The Coffre chief,, sensible the dollars could buy him nothing in his own country, whither he certainly might have carried them, and having heard, of the fine things to. be bought from the Dutch at Ternate, could not resist the temptation of laying out money, got unexpectedly, and for nothing. He therefore consenting, went, accompanied by ten or twelve people into the fort, and waited on the governor, who showed, him civility and respect. He then laid out his dollars. Presently a guard was turned out; and they thought themselves so sure of their prisoner, that they did not even shut the gates. When it was announced to him he must surrender, he whispered his people, (who were ready to mangamo (run a. muck) upon the occasion, to save their master, or sell their lives dear), not to stir in his defence, but to save themselves; whith, while the Rajah was delivering up his cress, (dagger) they immediately did ; and, running out of the fort, got on board their corocoro, and escaped. The Rajah is now prisoner at the Cape. Possibly the Dutch allowed his people to get away.

On the south coast of Java, during the N. E. monsoon, the winds are strong from the N.

Being there on board the Bonetta ketch, in the year 1763, I found plenty of bullocks, at two dollars, and hogs at one dollar each : ducks also in great quantities. I left Banditten Island on the left, steered for Bally Peak or Hill, and anchored in ten fathom, sandy ground, out of the tide, about half a mile from the shore. As there are no soundings, or at least, very deep water, just without where I anchored, I would recommend to the navigator to steer boldly for the houses of Carang As- sem, and anchor as I did, keeping the peak about N. by E. This I choose to be more particular in mentioning, as the India Directory, from wrong information, fays, there is no anchorage hereabouts. The stiip Experiment was also here, some years after me. When I anchored, the natives, who are Gentoos, came on board, in little canoes, with outriggers on each side. On the edges of the canoe, scr the bottom was too narrow, I put a gang caste, with which the owner paddled into a fresh water river, and, within twenty minutes, brought it full of water; for which service I paid ten or twelve China cash, with a hole in each, of which I bought four hundred for a Spanish dollar. * Of this circumstance I was informed by Captain Affleck, of his Majesty's ship Argo, who made the passage in 1764. z This"}, {"page_label": "Seite 237", "page_text": "170 ' 775 - May.

He sung as he came on board, in a small boat, with one attendant. His nails were remarkably long. In the road lay several prows, loaded with rice, from the adjacent island Lomboc, which is also inhabited by Gentoos; and on the sides of the hills of Lomboc are, I am informed, large pools or tanks of water, for the purpose of watering their rice fields, after the manner of the Gentoos ot Indostan, from whom they are certainly descended. The island Bally, on the south side, is well cultivated, and many of the grounds are inclosed ; it is full of inhabitants, who spin a great deal of cotton yarn, which the Chinese chiefly export to Bencoolen, and other parts, as well as checkered cloths, like Bengal Lungys made of it. The Chinese carry also in sloops and prows, from Bally to Fort Marlbro, pickled pork and dried (jerked) beef, which Malays call ding-ding. If a ship refreshes here, and the captain has a little patience, he will come off remarkably cheap. Iron, cutlery, and opium, are the articles of trade; but no quantity can be sold, as silver and gold are scarce.

It is of a triangular form, having three remarkable capes or promontories; one, near Samtoangan, where the Spaniards have their chief settlement, to the westward; Cape Augustine or Pandagitan, to the eastward; and Su- ligow to the northward. The island may be divided into three parts ; each under a distinct: and independent government. The first division, is under the Sultan, who resides at the town of Mindano or Selangan, by far the largest and most ancient.: it formerly comprehended the greatest part of the sea coast. The second is under the Spaniards, comprehending a large portion of the sea coast, to the west, north and north east, where they have planted colonies of Christians from the Philippines, called Bifaya. The third is under the Illano or 111 anon. Sultans and Rajahs, a fort of feudal chiefs, who inhabit the banks of the Great Lake or Lano, and thence a good way inland, towards the hills. The Illanos possess also the coast of that great bay, situated on the south side of the island. The island of Magindano may be about 800 miles round; as large as the kingdom of Ireland. The Spaniards, though they have subdued the north coast of the island, never conquered the whole. They sometimes call it a Philippine, in order to enlarge their own dominions; yet one of their most credible authors calls Magindano, an island adjacent to the Philippines. * * To the district of the Philippines and their confines, those ofMindaho are adjacent.

They have a name, which they give to their sons during childhood, and another for manhood : in this they resemble the Chinese. In their manners and customs are other particulars in which they resemble that nation; such as, yellow being the royal colour; guests * Histoire General de l'Asie, p. gcg. at"}, {"page_label": "Seite 247", "page_text": "A VOYAGE 176 KTay* at ^ eai ^ s ceremony having all different tables, and, in proportion v -' 11J to the greatness of the ceremony, the tables loaded.

Even many hundred years before the time of Marco Polo, the famous Venetian traveller, Eben Wahab, in the year 898, travelled to China, J- he mentions, that in China is Canfu, the city of Arabian traders. The capital of that empire was then called Cumdan, two months journey from Canfu. No wonder then that lome of the Arabs found their way to the itland of Magindano. 1 The Arabians were formerly great discoverers, and seldom failed to conquer the lands they had discovered. Their religion contributed to their influence, whithersoever they resorted.

No wonder therefore, that the moors soon sought and found such footing. Voyages in those days were not so safe or so frequent'as in these. For this reason, no doubt, the merchants stayed Jong at a place, took wives, built houses, &c. The town of Magindano stands about six miles from the bar of the river Pelangy, on the right hand going up, just where the river Melam- py joins it. The Pelangy is then about the width of the river Thames at London bridge. The Melampy is a river about half as broad as the Pelangy i and, as you go up, it strikes off to the right, whilst the Pelangy on the left, retains its breadth for many miles. A good way higher at Kabantallan, the Pelangy fends forth a branch bigger than itself, called the Tamantakka, which discharges itself into the sea, about three miles south of the Pelangy or Magindano bar. The remarkable hill of Timoko, an only hill at the sea side of a pretty large plain, lies between the mouths of the two rivers. The Tamantakka has three fathom water on its bar, at high water in spring tides; while only two fathoms are on the bar of the Pelangy. * Mindano omnium maxima regio, est cinnamomi commendata.

The mouth of the Pelangy, being much sheltered by the ifland of Btrnwoot, affords a stnooth bar almost at all times. No wonder then that* the small river is'preserred'to the greater, as the largest vessels on either, never draw above six or'seven foot water. From the south side of Magindano river, runs also a spit of sand, the extremity of which may be brought almost in one with the S. W. part of Bunwoot j* and then is fifteen fathom water.

This small lake is called the Dano; the creek I have just mentioned, is the Rawass (or river) Magindano; and from the banks of the lake or Dano, a little earth is taken, upon which the Rajah Moodo* must stand, when he is consecrated Sultan. The Rajah Moodo is elected by the states, and succeeds the Sultan; iimilar to the king of the Romans succeeding the emperors of Germany.

Close to the rawass (river) Magindano, and opposite the few houses making the town of that name, stands the town of Selangan, J which may be said to make one town with the other, as communicating with it by several bridges over the Rawass. It extends about one mile down the south side of the Pelangy, forming a decent street for one half of the distance. The fortified palace of the Sultan, and the strong wooden castles of the Datoo's, Topang and Chartow, take up one side of the river; the other fide is occupied by individuals.

In the town of Selangan altogether, may be about two hundred houses below the Sultan's palace* about twenty yards, is a brick and mortar foundation remaining of a Spanish chapel. But in a country thinly inhabited, and where ground is of no value, Mahometans especially, choose not to croud together; each desiring a house on the bank of a river. Peculiarly is this visible here, where, upon the winding banks of the Pelangy, the Melampy, the Taman- takka, and by the sides of the many creeks that intersect the ground between those capital rivers, at the distance of almost every three hundred yards, sometimes we fee a single house, sometimes a group of houses, with gardens of coco nut, mango, and plantain trees, sugar canes, and rice fields, for many miles up those rivers: particularly the Tamantakka, which being the greatest, its banks are bold and dry. They are too fond of bathing in fresh water, to wish the neighbourhood of the sea, though there are sbme villages of salt makers, who live always close to it. Their manner of making salt, will be related hereafter. As the country, through which those rivers lead often in a winding course, is a plain of about twelve miles broad, extending N.

E. as far as the lakes of Liguassin and Buloan, they travel mostly by water in sampans or canoes of different sizes; and many vessels of forty and fifty oars are built along the banks of those rivers. Wherever is a house, there is a small portion of the river sufficient for bathing, railed in, against Alligators a practice no less requisite at Selangan, where houses are built by the river side. The river Semoy, between Magindano river and Pollock harbour, issues from the Pelangy, and runs through a plain. I have observed, in going up the Tamantakka, that it is bounded to the southward by clear hills gently rising to no great height from its banks. They are diversified with woods, and clear spots of the coarse long grass, which the Malays call Lalang, Kutch Grafs. Though I have described the towns of Magindano and Selangan as making one, the name Selangan carries it generally over the other, among the people of the country. It stands on the south side of the Pelangy, where it is joined by the Melampy, about six miles from the bar. In the south west monsoon, when much rain is in the river, fresh water may be had just within the bar. The strongest current is with the ebb tide, which may then run about four miles an hour, especially after rain; and, during this monsoon, the tide seldom or never runs up.

An east or west moon makes high water, i - v - -1 During the north east monsoon, the highest tide is in she night, near eight o'clock ; and, .during this monsoon, the tide runs up about two or three miles an hour, a good way above Selangan. In both monsoons, the tides rife about fix inches higher on the full moon than on vthe change; then rife on the bar about six foot, and at town about six foot and a half perpendicular. This rife sometimes overflows a little the adjacent grounds; to obviate which inconvenience, the paths are in many places raised; as is, particularly at Selangan, the street which pastes the three capital houses. On the point of land, where the river Melampy runs into the ?s- langy, is a fort called Coto In tang, or Diamond Fort. Here, a few years since, Kybad Zachariel, some time ago elected Rajah Moodo, or successor to the Sultan, has built also a town. The fort is upon the extreme point of land, in extent about six acres, strongly palifadoed with round trees five and twenty foot high. This fort commands both rivers; and towards the Pelangy, the broader and more considerable, is a platform twelve foot from the ground. The floor is of stout plank, strongly supported by posts and beams. On this are mounted five pieces of cannon, six and nine pounders; and, being covered overhead, the platform is not so subject to decay as gun platforms generally are in this country, because mostly exposed to the weather. Guns are mounted under the platforms. When I was there, Rajah Moodo was constructing three solid bastions of clay and logs of wood intermixed, cased round with piles.

The rantacker is a gun sometimes six foot long, and carries a half pound ball, resembling Marshal 8axe's amufette. On each bastion of the fort, is a large Spanish bell, with a rat an ' made fast to the clapper.

He entertained me very politely, •as he knew my connexions; and early next morning we set out, accompanied by some of his people. At Tapidan, a river sets off to the right from the Tamantakka. Having mounted it about half a mile, we found running into it a small brook of a Iky blue colour, with a very offensive smell and taste. This brook comes from the hill, where opens the Saltpetre Cave. After paddling up about a mile, I left it on the right, and entered another brook of common fresh water. This with some difficulty (it being very shallow) brought me to the foot of the hill. Having climbed the hill a quarter of a mile pretty steep, I came to a hole, twelve yards to the right of the path way, and about ten foot diameter. I then descended by means of some poles laid slanting about thirty foot, to a circular area of twenty-sive diameter. Exactly above the center of this area is a hole about six foot diameter, which, besides the passage we came down by, gave light into it. I then descended about six yards through a sloping passage, which in height and width will admit only one man at a time, and that stooping, into a magnificent round hall, with a flat floor of earth. From the top hung somewhat like isicles; but from the sides seemed to spring half isicles, which, rising from the height of five or six foot to the dome, looked like the clustered columns of Gothic architecture.

Around us flfew an infinite number of small bats,* from which I defended myself by the lighted torch I carried in my hand. Many of these birds of darkness clung by little hooks at their wings- to the sides of the passage. 1 might have gone farther; but declined it. Returning, I saw the entrance into another passage, and felt a very small draft of air, which made our torches burn. This passage, I was told, went a good way, and gave another outlet; but at a distance reported so great, that none of my guides had ever ventured to explore it. As I went in barefooted, I found the miry stuff stick to my feet. Being very glutinous, it was not easily washed off. To make saltpetre, they mix one measure of this stuff with two of wood ashes; and then silter through it the water of which the saltpetre is made. The gunpowder they make here is very coarse grained, and has but little strength. Many of the countries above Boyan are subject to- the Rajah of Boyan.

Large stones loaded many ? places, even at the sea side ; and at fusing, near Pulo Ebus, I have seen fresh springs burst out, (at low water) from amongst black stones, of many tons weight, in various parts of that dry harbour. I was told that a river was formerly there, where is not the least appearance of one now. At present there seems to be a good deal of mould intermixt with the black sand, which is favourable to vegetation ; and the country hereabouts is now covered with long grafs, called lalang. In some places are reeds eighteen' foot high,-in others low trees and bushes. This varied landscape has an aspect the more peculiarly pleasing from the sea, that Malay countries in general, from Atcheen-head, to New Guinea, are burdened with unintermitted woods. Here, in time, a wood may reappear: for, in any warm country, alternate rain and sunstone, with few long dry.intervals, must greatly promote vegetation. During the eruption of the Volcano, the black sand was driven to Mindano, the ashes as far as Sooloo, which is about forty leagues * This mountain appears in the circular view of Bunwoot.

The island Bumvoot is about eighteen miles round : * its greatest breadth lies towards the 8. W. and its opposite end tapers towards the N.

The island is almost entirely covered with tall timber, free from underwood, except that in some places are ratans, creeping along the ground, and a certain plant, (byonos,) which resembles a vine. It creeps also along the ground, and twists about large trees: the largest part of the stem is about the size of a man's leg. The Mindanoers cut it into pieces, about a foot long, which they'bruise with a mallet upon a piece of hard wood. Thus bruised, it discharges a white juice in great quantity, which serves all the purposes of soap. Here grows a kind of rose wood, called narra, many dammer trees, and the tree that produces4he gum, called curuang. Towards the N.

The island from the S.W. appears like a wedge, or what seamen call a gunner's corn. If the island has few springs, it contains many ponds of rain water, frequented by a number of wild hogs, which afford excellent sport, when hunted by two dogs at least : for one dog will not stop them. The hogs are very swift, but not so large and formidable as some on the island Magindano. On Bunwoot the hogs are numerous, but have no gardens, cr rice fields to feed in. Their food is wild fruits, and what they pick up on the shore at low water, where they always attend in numbers. Those we caught had no fat; but those we got on Magindano were plump enough, though not to compare with tame hogs. Travelling in the woods here is always cool, through the shade of the lofty trees.

The hogs would then multiply and fatten, affording a never failing stock of good meat. There are also great quantities of sish.

Although the Sultan seems to act by and with the advice and consent of the Datoos, not only of his own family, but of others; yet, this compliance is perhaps only to save appearances.

The latter only may be sold with the lands, but cannot be sold off the lands. The Harasoras are more opprest than the jformer.

I then took respectful leave of Rajah Moodo. He delivered to me the two letters already mentioned; one to his Majesty, the other to the Company, with the presents. Nobody knew what they were, but himself and his father Fakymolano, who wrote the letters. I thanked him for all his generous civilities, and promised to write to him by the return of the boat, which I hoped to find at Borneo. He smiled to his wife, Potely Pyak, as I rose to go away ; which made me imagine, she knew or suspected I was going. As I went to my apartments, I found several persons who, from what they said, seemed to imagine me bound some whither; and, as two of Rajah Moodo's soldiers were to accompany me, I did not discourage the report that I was going to Tukoran on a visit, the where dwelt Sultan, Raj'ah Moodo's father in law. About half an hour after fun-set, I stepped into the boat, was on board in about forty minutes, and that night got over the bar. This privacy was for fear of the Sooloos, who were numerous in the river; and I suspected that Datoo Topang, their protector, thought I had slighted him.

Rajah Moodo, with the full stature of a man, has the eye, as well* as the nose of an eagle ; his understanding is quick as his eye : he preserves a constancy of good humour, which renders his manners open, as has been before acknowledged. Once, indeed, when one of my people struck another, in presence of his father, Rajah Moodo coming in, and being told of it, a cloud overcast his countenance. But, as I immediately begged the favour of being allowed to punish him, by confinement in irons, a smile returned j and he said : \" Do, punish your own way.\" Next day, however, he desired the release of the culprit. Ano- teen time, I was told, his armourer, or blacksmith, a Bisayan captive, being drunk, had dared to affront the Spanish envoy : Rajah Moodo so lost his usual self command, that, had it not been for the interposition of his lady, it was thought he would have put the miscreant to death on the spot. Among secondary qualifications, Rajah Moodo had that of a good mechanic : I was surprised to see the engines for raising heavy pieces of timber. He also made drums, like those in Europe, and was pleased to hear them used by his guards. About a month before I failed, I was sliort of goods. Rajah Moodo was so polite, as to offer me any quantity of kangans, to be paid at my convenience. I accepted the amount of two hundred kangans.

Fakymolano translated it into the Magindano language, and admired it much.- He would often ask me the abuses of the Romisli religion, and why we departed from them. I touched on this string very gently ; and, when I considered the Spaniard and myself, with some few people belonging to us, as the only persons at court, who being reckoned unclean, were doomed to drink our chocolate out of glass tumblers, while every one else drank out of fine china ; I confess, it greatly abated that gall, which has for ages dignified many personages, both in church and state, on the other fide of the globe. A little ridicule concerning indulgences, celibacy of priests, and the like, would now and then escape me; but I qualified my freedom, by assuring him that the world possessed no persons of greater honour than some Spaniards. Once, in a private conference with Fakymolano, I told him a story, which I have read somewhere, of an Italian priest, who kept a magazine of good works; a commodity in which he dealt, by way of transfer from his books to those afflicted mortals, whose consciences ' were out of repair; that he took care to provide, when possible, at the death of the godly, reassortments of stock, which he safely deposited in his warehouse 5 but sold very dear, especially to those who were in particular want; complaining always to his customers, that good works (Mapia Gunawan) were daily more scarce, and hardly to be had at any rate. Fakymolano would often say, Come, Captain, tell us the story about Mapia Gunawan.

I have heard of such on the island Salayer, and that they will whip -- up a goat from the ground : we read of such monstrous snakes being also on Ceylon. There is a large snake, called Bukkoron, found often on Ti- moko hill, which, in great floods, may be considered as an island; and the snakes carried away by the torrents, fasten where they can. Thus, in Indostan, I have been told, of snakes fastening on bridges, when born down a river by a flood. Here is also a smaller black poisonous snake, with a white throat and red eyes. Another, called Dolpu, is very large : its blowing or spitting on any person, is poisonous, making the body swell. Rajah Moodo mentioned to me a man on the island Lutangan, seized by an enormous snake, that having thrown him, swallowed his leg and thigh. The snake not being able to get higher, the man pulled out his cress, and cut the monster's mouth, which then disgorged him: the man, with leg and thigh much torn, survived. On Bunwoot, I have seen a small snake, spotted black and brown : its bite is thought to be venomous. On Ma- gindano are said to be Loories of the same kind with those that come from the Moluccas ; but they are so scarce, that I never saw any. The Cocatores, which abound in the rice fields, have asmooth head, and no tuft, like those we see come from different parts of India. AtSooloo, there are no Loories; but the Cocatores have yellow tufts. There are fowls, ducks, and geese ; the latter scarce; yet great is the plenty of gakey (teal) on the lakes Liguaffin and Buloan, and elsewhere. I forgot to mention a circumstance, that happened soon after my arrival at Mindano. \" Tw\""}, {"page_label": "Seite 383", "page_text": "zg6 A VOYAGE >776- Jauuary U \"\"■*•'' f Two slaves, man and wife, that had been taken by Datoo Uku, on board Mr. Cole's schooner, ran away from the Datoo's house, came to Coto Intang, and claimed my protection. I laid the affair before Rajah Moodo, who told me to keep them. The Sultan also hearing of it, approved. Rajah Moodo talking to the man one day, in my apartments, said, \" what kind of a person is your late master,\" meaning Datoo Uku, \" berenni dio, is he brave and without waiting for an answer, the Rajah went on, \" I saw him one day on the other side the water, peeping at me from behind the croud-why did he not come forward and show himself?\" Both Rajah Moodo and his father disapproved much of Uku's piracy, and I mentioned it frequently in pretty strong terms to the Sultan ; but he waved the subject, not daring (I suppose) to exert his authority, on account of Topang. One night Rajah Moodo collected some hundreds of glass beads, and by dividing the whole, the half, and so on continually, would tell me the original number. This I seemed desirous of being taught, which pleased him much: his courtiers admired his ingenuity. He writes in Spanish, and prefers, in calculation, the Roman figures to the Arabic. As he is a performer on the fiddle, I presented him with two violins, and a german slute : he had a Bisayan, one os his guards, who played tolerably by ear on the violin. I wrote down some minuets, and Rajah Moodo submitted to be taught a little by book. Having got a slight idea of it, he applied no more; but had recourse, as before, to the ear. They wondered at my writing down, and afterwards playing with my slute, some tunes they had played on their musical gongs, called Kalintang.

Rajah Moodo had but one wife, Potely Pyak, daughter to the Sultan of Tukoran. His fourteen or fifteen concubines slept on mats bespreading the floor of a large hall, in which he and his lady occupied a large bed. Sometimes he went with his consort and concubines to a little garden, just without Goto In tang, where, under a shade, he and his friends would regale with chocolate and sweet cakes. In this garden he had some European coleworts, which he got from 8am- boangan ; also onions, parsley, spearment, and the Spanish raddish, which the Mindanoers call Lobuc, as the Malays do; but neither turnips nor carrots: there was also one vine. He frequently sent me part of what few growths he had. His lady spoke good Malay, and was fond of singing a Malay stanza, which I had the honour of teaching her.

Fakymolano did not like him at all. The people of Magindano, and their neighbours, known commonly by the name of Oran Illanon, as living near the great Lano, are very pir^tically inclined. Neither can the Sultan of Magindano restrain his subjects from sitting out vessels, which go among the Philippines, to Mangaio, that is, cruise against the Spaniards: much less can be restrained the Illanos, being under a government more aristocratic, for, on the banks of the Lano, are no fewer than seventeen, stiled Rajahs, and sixteen who take the title of Sultan, beside those on the coast.

These, within ten years before 1775, have done much mischief to the Spaniards, among the islands called Babuyan, at the north extremity of the Philippines j and, at this time, they possess an island in the very heart of the Philippines, called Burias, where has been a colony of Illanos, for many years, men, women, and children. The Spaniards have often attempted to dislodge them; but in vain : the island, which is not very large, being environed with rocks and shoals to a considerable distance. Some of the vessels that they fit out as cruisers, are very small and narrow. Many I have seen fifty foot long, and only three broad; availing themselves, however, of outriggers, without which they could not keep upright. They all use the tripod mast, lyre tanjong, and row with great velocity. In bad weather they throw out a wooden anchor, and veer away a long ratan cable, which keeps their head to sea. Sometimes in an extremity, the crew will jump overboard, and, with their bodies under water, hold by the outriggers for hours together, to ease the vessel's weight: and certainly the crew is most of the loading, for the vessels carry no ballast, and draw little water, in their passage from island to island. When the boat or prow is large, with her tripod mast struck, they hide among rocks, islands, or in the woods, up some creek. They then detach small sampans, or canoes, to surprize what they can ashore, or afloat, and bring to the capital vessel; which goes home, when she has got a sufficient cargo of slaves and plunder.

It is certain, several deputations were sent from Ternate, under Mr. Thim, and in the time of Mons. de Long, for the purpose of seeking gold, and to take it where it could be found. In 1689, Lieutenant Meindert de Roi, went out with an ester of two thousand rix dollars, from the Dutch East India Company, as a present to the Sultan; for liberty to build a fort; but was politely refused. \" In 1693, Admiral Vanderduin and Mynheer Haak were there, aster making a survey of the islands Tagalanda, Siaou, Sangir, &c.

The Dutch Admiral and Mynheer Haak were very particular in their enquiries about gold; but there was not the least appearance of it. Touching at Se- rangani, the son of the king of Kandahar, on Sangir, came to them, and told the Dutch admiral, that Serangani belonged to his father : he brought some rice ; but aiked dear for it : he also asked dear for bullocks, faying, the Englilh had given twenty-five and thirty rix del- lars a piece; twenty rix dollars a pecul for wax, and twelve rix dollars for the weight of a rix dollar of gold dust.

This I did, in order to try him; but he was too sincere to deny that Sangir was always indepen- dant, till lately the Dutch had got it from Ternate. The islands of Salibabo, Kabruang and Nanusan, were under Sangir, consequently now under the Dutch; but no European was at Leron or Salibabo, when I was there. Malary Rajah of Sangir, a great many years ago, had a granddaughter named Sembaffin, who married Abdaraman, Sultan of Magindano. Her brother Manalantan, Rajah of Sangir, gave Salibabo, and the fourth part of the island Tulour, to his grand nephew Fakymolano. This gives Magindano a right to some part of the Sangir dominion; and on this island of Tulour, Fakymolano's brother was killed in a fray, in the year 1773. Possibly he was exercising his power too roughly: for the revenues are most cruelly collected from those defenceless islanders, in a certain number of slaves. The inhabitants are continually accusing one another of trespasses, in order that the Kolano, or head man of a village, may, by trial and fine, make up the number annually demanded. Sangir is an oblong island, extending from the latitude of 3 0 30', to 4 0 30' north, and lying in the longitude of 122° 20\" east of Greenwich.

E. by two pretty large islands, Pulo Noeslfa, and Pulo Bookit, the latter highly cultivated. Many more harbours are towards the south end of this island, along the middle of which runs a ridge of high mountains, terminated to the northward by a high -volcano, from which, according to Valentine, was an eruption in iju, preceded by a dreadful earthquake. Valentine fays also, there are forty-six islands, large and small, around Sangir, and that the king of Kandahar on Sangir, had a claim upon part of Mindano. Sangir contains many Nigris : the chief are Tabookan, Kandahar, Taroona, Maganaloo and Sarah, in all which are reckoned about six thousand males, who wear breeches. It abounds in coco nuts, as do many islands that lie near it. A fathom of small brass wire, such as is used at the end of a fishing line, will purchase a hundred coco nuts; an ordinary knife three hundred ; and four knives a battel (60 Ib.) of coco nut oil. This I mention, as the rate of barter or exchange to those who may occasionally touch there, and are not in a hurry. It has also bullocks, goats, hogs, and poultry; but its chief export is coco nut oil.

For, while the trade was open to Japan, there came from thence two or three strips laden with silver, amber, silks, chests, cabinets, and other curiosities, made of sweet scented woods; with vast quantities of silks, quilts, and earthen ware, from China.

In great abundance do they enjoy a very innocent and delicious fruit, by Malays called Lancey. The trees in the woods are,loaded with this fruit, which is large, and ripens well : this it does not on the istand of Sumatra, where, perhaps, it finds too much moisture. The Sooloos having great connexion with China, and many Chinese being settled amongst them, they have learned the art of ingrafting and improving their fruits, while the fruits at Magindano have remained indifferent. The Sooloos have a very good breed of horses, which they train to trot fast, seldom suffering them to gallop. When I was there in 1773, I saw often Datoos and their ladies ride in this manner, as mentioned in the journal. At Sooloo are none of those beautiful birds called Loories; but there is abundance of diminutive Cocatores, and small green parrots. There is no spice tree, but the cinnamon.

I have been told that their haughty lords visiting their estates, will sometimes with impunity demand and carry off young women, whom they happen to fancy, to swell the number of their Sandles (Concubines) at Sooloo. Variously do those islands groan under the tyranny of their masters. When I was here, one Jaffier had just returned from the island Tappool, where he had been settling petty insurrections.

The present Sultan Israel, to whom his father Amiralmoomine had given up the reigns of government, in 1773* hinted to me they have gold in their hills j but that, for the above reason, they discourage the searching after it.

They have also prows much smaller, down to sampans; but their sampans are seldom of one tree, large timber not abounding on Sooloo, as on the more considerable adjacent islands.

The Sooloos have a particular way of fishing with hook and line. They put into the boat a number of stones, about a pound weight each j then wind their line with the baited hook round one of the stones, and throw it overboard into deep water. The stone descends, and when the fisherman judges it has quitted the hook, he pulls this up to the surface, with or without a fish. On the same principle do they fish amongst the Molucca islands, by fixing the hook to the leaf of a coco nut tree, tied to a stone, as has been related in the account of New Guinea. They also bruise a certain plant called tublee, which they then put either into the sea or fresh water ; its juice slupifies the fish, which then stoats dead atop; this is practised in all Malay countries. The Sooloo tongue has a good deal of the Bifayan or Philippine mixed with it; also a little of the Magindano dialect, and some Malay words. The character is, with some variation, the Arabic.

It is this choice fort which is exported yearly by the Dutch East India Company, by whom it has been prohibited under severe penalties, that any other fort whatever should be mixt with it. \" The second sort is called canatte coronde, that is, bitter and astringent cinnamon; for the Ceylonese, in their language, call cinnamon in general coronde; and canatte signifies bitter and astringent. The bark of this tree comes off very easily, and smells very agreeably, when fresh; but has a bitter taste. It is an advantage to us that this does not grow in great plenty hereabouts; because, else, one might easily mistake it for a better ; as indeed, in general, it requires a good deal of skill and attention so to distinguish the cinnamon trees from each other, as not to choose now and then an inferior sort for the best.

It grows plentifully enough on the island, but not in the eastern parts of it. However, they find means, now and then, to fend it over privately and fell it to the Danes and English, who come to trade upon the coast of .Coromandel; for, as long as there is one port in the island left open, abundance of this fort of bad merchandise may be exported. Besides, there is a fort of a canella, growing upon the continent of India, about Goa, which is very like this species of cinnamon tree, though it has nothing of the true cinnamon. The fame fort of canella agrees in many respects with the canella Malabarica sylvejlris , a wild cinnamon tree, growing upon the coast of Malabar. And although, with regard to the shape of the tree, and the outward appearance of the bark and leaves, there is very little difference to be observed between these two sorts of canella, and the above-mentioned first and good fort of cinnamon, yet the latter is vastly superior in richness, sweetness, and virtue. \" The fourth fort of cinnamon is called by the Ceylonese, weUe coronde, that is, the sandy cinnamon ; because, upon chewing it, one feels, as it were, bits of sand between the teeth; though, in fact, there is nothing sandy in it. The bark os this tree comes off easily enough; but is not so easily rolled up into a fibulas form as other forts of cinnamon are, being apt to burst open and unfold itself.

The bark of this fort of cinnamon tree has no manner of taste or smell, when, taken off, and is made use of by the natives only in physic- By roasting it, they obtain a water and oil, with which they anoint themselves, thinking, by such liniment, to keep off all noxious fumes and infections in the air. They likewise extract a juice from the leaves, which they fay cools and strengthens the brain, if the head be rubbed with it. \" The seventh fort is called dawei coronde, that is, drum cinnamon; in Low Dutch, trommel caneel. The reason of this appellation is, that the wood of this tree, when grown hard, is light and tough; and that fort, of which the natives make some of their vessels and drums, which they call dawel, is stript of its bark, while the tree is yet growing, and is of a pale colour.

On the contrary, if you taste the inner membrane of the bark, when fresh taken off, you will find it of a most exquisite sweetness, and extremely pleasant to the taste; whereas the outward part of the bark differs but very little in taste from that of the common trees; which shows plainly, that its whole sweetness is owing to the inner membrane.

And, to clear up this point, it must be observed, that the bark may yet be taken from the trees, which have stood sourteen^fif- teen, or sixteen years, according to the quality of the foil they stand in ; but, beyond that time, they grow thicker, and lose, by degrees their taste and agreeable sweetness, while the bark contracts the taste of camphire : besides, the bark Is then grown so thick, that, though laid in the sun, it will no longer shrink and wind itself up, but remain flat. And here it may be thought a fit subject of enquiry, how it comes to pass, that, considering what vast quantities of cinnamon have been exported from this island, and fold all over the world, by Europeans as well as natives, for two hundred years past; and since the way hither, by the East Indies, has been but some centuries explored by the Portuguese, (long before was it discovered and known) j I say, how, considering this, it comes to pass, that there are still such numbers of good trees sit to be barked, and growing yearly, on the island. To solve this question, several authors, describing the island of Ceylon, have committed a considerable mistake, when they assure their readers, that, when the bark has been stript off the trees, it grows again in four or"}, {"page_label": "Seite 432", "page_text": "TO NEW GUINEA. or five years, and becomes fit for stripping anew; I can assure you, '776. J Januarys Sir, that this assertion is equally contrary to the course of nature, and ' - ' the possibility of observation. Nor do I believe, that there is, in any part ofithe world, a tree, which, if entirely stript of its bark, could 5 grow, or even Vegetate longer. That part, at least,' where the bark has been taken off, will quickly parch, and die away j but the root may meantime remain entire, and in-good condition ; which shows, why such a number of trees is ready to be barked every year. For, although the cinnamon tree, after the bark has been once taken off, is cut down to the very root, as are in Europe oaks, birches, alders, and willows- yet, the root will quickly push forth new shoots, which will ripen in a short time ; I mean, in five, six, seven, or eight years, - some sooner, some later, and then yield their quantity of bark. Hence it appears, how far the old roots are instrumental to the growth and plenty of cinnamon trees; but the fruit which falls from the ' trees, contributes much towards the fame end : and it is particularly owing to a certain kind of wild doves, which, from their seeding on the fruit of the cinnamon tree, are called cinnamon eaters , that the tree grows so plentifully in this island. For the doves, when they fetch food for their young, flying here and there, disperse vast quantities of the fruit all over the fields; which occasions the rife of so many thousand young trees, along the roads, that they look like s sorest. So plentifully grows here this excellent tree: I call it excellent, because indeed, I know of none preferable.

The horrid custom already mentioned, paves the way : the transition hinted by the author of the origin of despotism, sufficiently points it out.

The Soo- loos have lately subdued them, by getting the Rajah (or chief) into their power. * These Oran Tedong fit out vessels large and small, and cruise among the Philippine islands, as has been formerly said. -f* They also cruise from their own country, west to Pirate's point, and down the coast of Borneo, as far as the island Labuan. After an excursion I once made from Balambangan to Patatan, a little beyond the island Puio Gay a ; on my return, I put into a small bay, east of Pirate's point, almost opposite Balambangan.

I have heard of some such, once shut up in a bay by a Spanish cruiser : they took their boats to pieces, and carried them away over land. The Oran Tedcng make a great deal of granulated sago, which they sell to the Sooloos very cheap; perhaps at one dollar a pecul. The Sooloos, as has been said, sell this again to the China Junks. Before I leave this people, I must mention, with whatever reluctance, one thing said of them, that speaks the barbarity of those who have had no revealed religion, Jewish or Christian, Mahometan or Jen too. When the Oran Tedong get into their hands many prisoners, tosecure themselves, they will lame some of the stoutest; nay leave them, on perhaps a little sandy island, (of which are many in the Sooloo archipelago, and among the Philippines) till they be at leisure to fetch them.

Pulo Tiga is so called, as consisting of three islands, pretty close, and of a gentle slope ; each having an even outline, and a fine white beach : they bear from Keemanees point, N.

The houses are built on each side the river upon posts, and you ascend to them by stairs and ladders,, as to back doors of warehouses in Wapping. The houses on the leftside, going up, extend backwards to the land, each in a narrow slip.. The land is not steep, but shelving; every house has therefore a kind of stage, erected for connexion with the land. There is little intercourse from house to house by land, or what may be called behind ; as- there is no path, and the ground is swampy r the chief communication; proves thus in front, by boats, On the right, going up, the houses extend about half a mile backwards, with channels like lanes, between the rows ; so that it would ^ seem, the river, before the houses were built, made a wide bason of shallow water, in which have arisen three quarters* of the town, resembling Venice j with many water lanes, if I may so fay,, perpendicular and parallel to the main river, which here is almost as wide as the Thames at London bridge, with six fathom water in the channel ^ and here lie moored, head and stern,theChina junks* four orfiveof which come annually from Amoy, of five or six hundred tons burden. The water is fait, and the tide runs about four miles an hour in the springs. Some of the houses on the right side of the water, are two stories high, which I never saw in any other Malay country, with stages or wharfs before them, for the convenience of trade. At Paflir, on the opposite side of this island, the houses front the river* some have stages or wharfs in front * but there are no water lanes as here at Borneo. At Paflir, the river is fresh, and often rapid * at Borneo, the river is salt, and seldom rapid. la"}, {"page_label": "Seite 472", "page_text": "TO NEW G U r N E A. In those divisions of the town, made by the water lanes* is neither firm land nor island ; the houses standing on posts, as has been said, in shallow water; and the public market is kept sometimes in one part, sometimes in another part of the river. Imagine, a sleet of London wherries; loaded with fish, fowl* greens, &c. floating up with the tide, from London Bridge towards Westminster; then down again, with many buyers floating up and down with thern j this wilb give some idea of a Borneo market. Those boats do not always drive with the tide, but sometimes hold by the stairs of houses, or by stakes, driven purposely into the river,- and sometimes by one another : yet,, in the course of a forenoon, they visit most part of the town, where the water lanes are broads The boat people (mostly women) are provided with large bamboo hats, the shade of which covers great part of the body, as they draw themselves up under it, and sit, as it were,, upon their heels. The many alligators here, do not make their appearance in the day* but at night; and it is dangerous falling out of a boat. Yet it is surprising, in how small canoes the natives will go up and down the river. The alligators lurk under the houses, living upon any offal, that gets through a kind of lattice floor. So at Batavia, the alligators frequent-the river's mouth,- for what comes from the city. Considerable is the commerce between China and Borneo, somewhat like the trade from Europe to America. Seven junks were at Borneo in 1775. They carry to China great quantities of black wood, which is worked up there into furniture, &c. it is bought sot about two dollars a pecul; and fold for five or fix: also ratans, dammer 38 i 1776.

The best native camphire is exported hence ; superior, I have been told, .to the Barroos camphire on Sumatra. It looks no better, but is much dearer, selling for ten or twelve Spanish dollars the Chinese catty ; Barroos camphire, looking as well, being worth no more than seven and eight dollars a catty. The Chinese are good judges of camphire. A great deal of this valuable drug comes from those parts of the ifland Borneo, that were ceded to us by the Sooloos. At Borneo- town, the Chinese sometimes build junks, which they load with the rough produce of the ifland Borneo, and send thence to China. I have seen a dock close to the town, in which a China junk of 500 tons had lately been built, worth 2500 taels, and .8000 in China. Could these junks come readily at our woollens, they would distribute immense quantities through the northern parts of China. 'Here are many Chinese settled, who have -pepper gardens. They do not let the vine, which bears the pepper, twist round a chinkareen tree, as is the custom on Sumatra j but drive a pole, or rather a stout . post, into the ground, so that the vine is not robbed of its nourishment. The Chinese keep the ground very clean between the rows of vine; and I have seen them pull off the vine leaves,; faying, they did it that the pepper corn might have more fun. I have here counted seventy, sometimes seventy-sive, corns of pepper on one st ilk; which is more than the stalks produce on Sumatra; and 1 am apt to think the chinkareens on Sumatra are hurtful, as they not only rob the ground, but take up much of the planter's time in trimming the luxuriant branches, that these may not overfhade the vine.

The Chinese here are very active and industrious. They-brings all kinds of the manufacture of china, and keep shops on board their junks, as well as ashore > but the Borneans do their best to preclude them from dealing with the Maroots, reserving the trade for themselves. I do not find that the Maroots grow pepper. The Chinese alone plant it. It is all sent to China. We found it dearer than at Pastir,. where it was ten dollars a pecul : here it is fourteen and fifteen. I am surprised they do not encourage the Maroots to plant this commodity. This..was Mr. Dalrymple's idea in his plan concerning Balambangan. Xt gives, a European pleasure to see the regularity and cleanliness on board the Chinese vessels. To the latter much contributes their not using tar. Their tanks for water are sweet and convenient. They have the art of putting a mixture of lime and oil into their seams on the deck, 8cc. which hardens and keeps them tight. This is much cleaner than pitch ; but, if the deck worked at sea, I apprehend this calking would break, and the junk prove leaky. Their cook rooms are remarkably neat. The crew all eat off china; and in a harbour, every one is employed without noise about his own business. Among Malay trading vessels, prevail a languor and deadnefs: every thing they do is in a slovenly manner, which disgusts Europeans. If the profits t 383 1776.

From this censure I except the Buggcffes, who are really men of business. Malays mix liquid opium with a certain herb called madat, and this they smoke in a large pipe.* Mr. Palmer being ill at Balambangan, received benefit from thus taking opium : he had tried to take it, as is\" usual, in drops of laudanum ; but so, it broke his rest. It is a custom in port, both on board Malay and Chinese vessels, to hang in the water, close forward over each bow, a bag of lime : this impregnating the water near the surface, in their opinion, keeps off the worm. : 1 , The government at Borneo is. of a mixed kind, as at Magindano and Sooloo. The first person is stiled the Fang de Patuan ; and the second j the Sultan. Then come the Pangarans (nobles) about fifteen in number, who often tyrannise over the people. The Borneans havethe character of a sensible, steady people, and are said to have much primitive strictness and simplicity of manners.: they detest the Sooloos, who are gay and agreeable in private life, but restless as a state, and stick at \"othing to promote their ambition.

Then, my mate, David Baxter, and Laurence Lound the gunner, went ashore, refusing to proceed, as objecting to the vessel. On the 31st, I hauled her ashore, and shifted about three foot of bad plank on each side. By the sixth of jlpril, having finished the repairs of the vessel, I strongly invited my mate and gunner to continue with me; but they would not. On the seventh, I failed; and, on the thirteenth, arrived in Atcheen Road, where I found Thomas Palmer, Esquire, late third of Balambangan, in a sloop at anchor. We agreed to keep company to Bencoolen. I staid ashore at Atcheen, till the seventeenth, to recover my health, having been indisposed since I left Queda.

The chart of Atcheen published in the directory, is sufficiently accurate as to the road, and the Surat passage; but, off Pulo Brass are soundings, twenty fathom sandy ground, not marked in that chart, where any ship may safely anchor out of the currents, and wait a shift of wind. The Surat passage is bold and safe for a ship to work through in either monsoon. In the springs, the tide runs five and six knots; but, immediately to the southward or northward of this narrow pass (which, being formed by two promontories, has no length, and is about eighty fathom in width) the tide slacks. I would advise, in working thro' against the S. W. monsoon, to lay the ship's head to the main of Sumatra, with the main topsail aback, because the perpendicular rock is steep to, the shore of the opposite island not being so bold. In the passage, and near it, the ground is foul. Having got through, the tide will favour the navigator past Pulo Gomez, between which and Sumatra, is a safe channel with good anchoring ground : the tide will also favour as far as Siddo harbour,* if the ship is kept all the way pretty near the shore, where is good anchoring. Going into this harbour, the Sugar Loaf hill and the Slipper rock are remarkable: you* may keep close to the Slipper rock, and lie very safe in either monsoon. Here wood and water may be had, and refreshments as at Atcheen : bullocks much cheaper.
