I N the early periods of Navigation, it does not seem that the extension of Commerce was altogether the aim of the enterprizing Adventurer ; and though generally patronized by the reigning Powers, where these designs originated, yet, a thirst after glory, and a boundless ambition of adding to the strength and extent of territory, on one hand, or a rapacious desire of accumulating wealth, or, perhaps the fame of making discoveries, on the other, appear to have been the only objects in view. There cannot be a greater proof of the truth of this position, than the uniform behaviour of the Spaniards, in the whole course of their almost unbounded acquisitions of discovery, conquest, and wealth. The shocking barbarities practised by them when they conquered what was then called the New Wor Id , cast such an indelible stain on that period of their annals, as time can never obliterate.

Indeed, if we regard adventurers from our own Country in a commercial point of view, even so lately as the latter part of the last, or beginning of the present century, we shall find the generality of them little better than free-booters ; but on the other hand, were we to take a retrospective view of the several voyages made immediately under the patronage of Government, during the space of the last fifty years, we shall not only find them set on foot for the benefit of mankind in general, but that their endeavours to improve Navigation, and the different Sciences connected therewith, have been attended with the most brilliant success ; and it is not easy to< say, whether that zeal for the general good which first projected these voyages, or the constant wish to have the result of them made universally public, reflects the greatest lustre on their royal and munificent patrons.

It is needless to trace this excellent Navigator's Discoveries any farther to the Northward, as they are unconnected with the present Voyage, and their importance is well known to the world ; but it may be necessary to observe, that Captain Cook met with furs only in Cook's River, Prince William's, and King George's Sounds, so that these places were most likely to engage the attention of any persons who stiould engage in that branch of commerce. Who the Gentlemen were that first embarked in the fur-trade, is perhaps not generally known, though it is certain they were not hardy enough to fend vessels in that employ directly from England ; for we find, that the first vessel which engaged in this new trade was fitted out from China: she was a brig of fixty tons, commanded by a Captain Hanna, who left the Typa in April, 1785. His destination was for King George's Sound, where he arrived the following August. Soon after his arrival, the natives attempted to board his vessel in open day, but were repulsed with considerable slaughter: this assair secured the friendstiip of the Indians, for they afterwards traded quietly and peaceably.

The fame Gentleman failed again from Macao in May, 1786, in the Sea Otter, of one hundred and twenty tons, and arrived at King George's Sound in August. The success he met with in this expedition was never made known, but no doubt it was greatly inferior to that of his former voyage: he arrived at Macao in February, 1787. The siiow Lark, Captain Peters, of two hundred and twenty tons and forty men, failed from Macao in July, 1786. Captain Peters had orders to make the North West Coast, by way of Kamfchatka, and was directed to examine the islands to the Northward of Japan. He arrived at Kamfchatka the 2 0th of August, and left that place the 18 th of September. Accounts have stnce been received, that this vessel was lost on Copper Island, and that only two of the people were saved.

These ve s~ sels arrived at Nootka the end of June following; from thence they proceeded to Prince William's Sound. After some stay there, they left the coast, and afterwards arrived safe at Macao; but the quantity of furs they procured is supposed to have been very inconsiderable. In the Spring of the same year, 1786, two vessels were fitted out from Bengal, viz. the Nootka, of two hundred tons, Captain Meares, and the Sea Otter, of one hundred tons, Captain Tipping. Captain Meares failed from Bengal in March, and an account of his destination is given in the following Work, as he was met with by us in Prince William's Sound. The Sea-Otter, Captain Tipping, left Calcutta a few days after the Nootka. Her destination was for Prince W illiam's Sound. where she arrived in September, whilst the Captain Cook and the Experiment were there.

The Imperial Eagle, Captain Berkley, left Ostend the latter end os November, 1786, and arrived at Nootka the beginning of June, 1787. Some account of his expedition will be met with in the present Voyage. Having given a brief abstract of the different Voyages which have hitherto been made to the North West Coast of America, I cannot help noticing an expedition that was planned prior to any of them, and which, had it been carried into execution, must have proved exceedingly advantageous to the Proprietors, and very probably would have entirely engrossed this lucrative branch, of commerce. So early as 1781, William Bolts, Esq; fitted out the Cobenzell, an armed strip of 700 tons, for the North- West Coast of America. She was to have failed from Trieste (accompanied by a tender of forty-five tons) under Imperial colours, and was equally fitted out for trade or discovery : men of eminence in every department of science were engaged on board ; all the maritime Courts of Europe were written to, in order to secure a good reception for these vessels, at their respective ports, and favourable answers were returned ; yet, after all, this expedition, so exceedingly promifing in every point of view."}, {"page_label": "Seite 21", "page_text": "INTRODUCTION, xxi view, was overturned by a set of interested men, then in power at Vienna.

Though this was so long since as the year 1780, yet the prosecution of any plan lay dormant till Spring last, when a set of gentlemen procured a charter from the South Sea Company, and were incorporated for the express purpose of carrying on this trade to the best advantage ; to facilitate which, they purchased two vessels, and got them ready for sailing with all expedition.

As I am a perfect stranger to every person on board, and equally so to the manners and customs of a sea-faring life, I am determined to assimilate myself as much as possible to both, or, as Chesterfield phrases it, to be \" All things to all men.\" This, I am afraid, will be no easy task, but surely the object in view is well worth any pains I can take to attain it. I know thee to be so fond of characters, that thou art already impatient to be acquainted with those of my sirip-mates; but don't be too much in a hurry ; at a future opportunity I perhaps may oblige thee with an attempt of the descriptive kind.

The prospect on each fide the river, though not so enriched with gentlemen's feats, or pleasure grounds, as beyond London the other way, is truly pleasing : it affords many extensive views, which are agreeably variegated, and incontestibly prove, that Nature alone is often superior to the utmost refinements of Art. The wind and tide being in our favour, we came to anchor at Gravefend about two o'clock. Near this place is Tilbury Fort, the sight of which reminded me of G. A. Stevens's Politician, in his celebrated Lecture on Heads.. After dinner, I went with the Surgeon in one off our boats to Gravefend, to purchase some necessaries for our mess,, and to gratify my curiosity with a sight of the place : but I can give thee no farther description: of it, than that the streets are • narrow and dirty, and the inhabitants chiefly those who gain a. livelihood by employment either at sea, or on the.river.. Though we were got thus far, yet our voyage had like to have been greatly retarded, on the following account.. The articles of agreement being read to the people this evening, they refused to sign them without a greater advance of wages than is usually given; but this Captain Portlock absolutely refused to comply with, and after reasoning with them some time, they chearfully agreed to proceed on the voyage : thus, by the address of Captain Portlock was this hiatus got over, which otherwise would have proved very disagreeable, and possibly have lost us the season- On the 30th in the morning, the people of both ships were paid what wages were due to them, together with a month's advance, which they presently laid out in purchasing necessaries of the flop- boats"}, {"page_label": "Seite 38", "page_text": "V> A VOYAGE TO THE ^7 8 5boats that came along-side us, and who never fail to attend on -T_ these occasions, well knowing that a proper sailor can never go to sea with a safe conscience, whilst he has any money in his pocket. The tide serving about eleven o'clock, we weighed anchor, and stood for the Downs. The water now began to have a greenish cast, and the ship having a good deal of motion, I began to feel myself rather sick, but it presently went oft', and I never felt any thing of it afterwards, which was rather extraordinary, as there are few fresh water sailors who are not troubled with fea-sicknefs. The perspective might now be said to have rather a nautical appearance, as our distance from stiore'was considerable, though we never lost sight of land. The day was agreeable and pleasant, and we came to anchor about eight o'clock in the evening (without any material occurrence) near Margate, that place so much frequented in the season by the wives and daughters of the better fort of London citizens, who resort here for the purposes of drinking sea-water, washing away the smoke and d ust of London, aping the manner s of people in high life, pulling to pieces the reputation of their neighbours, and carefully concealing any flaws in their own. The wind being fair, we again weighed anchor early in the morning, and after a pleasant day's fail, brought to a-breast of Deal in the evening* The situation of Deal is pleasant enough, and particularly convenient for the contraband trade, which is carried on here to a very great extent, on account of its vicinity to the Downs, and the shelter it affords for homeward-bound ships.

I could not behold the Castle without calling to mind that celebrated description of the prospect from it in- our immortal Shakespeare's King Lear. The day being pretty cles\"r, we could plainly seethe Coast of France, and were in full view of Albion's chalky cliffs, those objects so pleasing to a sailor, after a long voyage, and which I ardently hope to have the satisfaction of again beholding a few years hence.. We had very little variety, in our progress, till the 5th, when a very heavy gale of wind sprung up, and our vessel was tossed about at the mercy of the winds and waves. Every thing now was hurry and disorder ; and the creaking of the ship's timbers, the noise of the people on deck running backwards and forwards, and the howling of the winds amongst the masts and, yards added to the general confusion. During this scene, I kept below in the steerage, in a situation; not very agreeable thou mayest be sure : indeed had I given way to the first impulses- of fear, I should have been more dead than alive ; but I had recollection enough to reflect, that our First and Second Mates were experienced seamen, and that if we were in any imminent danger, I should know it by their countenances, which were the barometer by which I regulated; my feelings ; and this prudent step a good deal leflened my anxiety, for I learned from their discourse that they did not apprehend any great danger, except from a lee shore, and we had day-light in our favour, and at a considerable distance from land.

The place for 1785. vessels that are laid up, or repairing, being up a narrow creek, September , which divides Portsmouth from Gosport. One of the first objects that presented itself to my view, on our first coming to anchor, was the masts of the Royal George, which ship, thou mayest remember, went to the bottom a few years ago. It is a melancholy reflection, that near fifteen hundred poor fouls should perish in a moment, many of whom were of the first families. There are a number of line of battle ships at anchor here, the sight of which is quite a novelty to me ; but that which renders the prospect from hence completely charming, is the beautiful landscape which the Isle of Wight affords. Nothing in Nature can present a more delectable appearance, than the enchanting verdure of its fields and meadows. I can fay nothing of its insulated appearance, but am told, that it is at least equal to the coast ; if so, it must be a most desirable residence for those who are fond of a country retirement. Spithead is a most excellent market for the farmer to dispose of his various produce, the number of ships constantly lying here consuming more than they can possibly furnish them with, and for which they in general obtain good prices, (particularly in time of war) though we laid in both live stock and other necessaries for our mess very reasonable, such as hogs, geese, fowls, rabbits, ducks, and hams; cheese, butter, onions, potatoes, &c.

We were on board several hours, but I am too great a novice in sea matters to give thee any tolerable description of a man of war: indeed I had it not in my power, if I had ability, for, being an absolute stranger to every body, (the Doctor totally engrosled by his old stup-mates) I could not with propriety ask any particular questions. Thus far I can tell thee, that the decks, and indeed every passage and gangway, are kept as neat and clean as a good country housewife would her trenchers : they have not near so many people on board as in time of war, but even then, I am told they are equally attentive in regard to cleanliness. This, I believe, was far from being the cafe formerly, till absolute neeeffity convinced them of its utility. In absolute governments one, perhaps, might fee inferior ranks of people kept in due subordination, though an Englishman can ill brook it, liberty and freedom being with him innate principles ; but the Captain of a man of war is, I understand, more absolute than the most despotic monarch. Prudence may, sometimes, make this exertion of power necessary, as a man of war, (like a common fewer) is the receptacle for the most profligate and abandoned of mankind. We dined on board, along with upwards of twenty Midshipmen, Doctor's Mates, &c. and every thing was conducted with the utmost regularity and decorum, accompanied with a politeness which I was far from expecting at sea, and which, I believe, is not always the cafe; harmony and decorum, nay, common decency, being pretty often kicked out of doors. In regard to Portsmouth I can say but little, being there only a few hours. I am told it is the best fortified of any place in the kingdom, and I am apt to believe it.

In time of war, the people 1785. at inns, and places of public resort, are particularly exorbitant in their charges, finding, I suppose, that proverb verified, that \" Sailors get their money like horses, and spend it like asses.\" This, how ever, is not always the cafe, for I supped and spent a very convivial evening with our First Mate, and a relation of Captain Dixon's, at the Star and Garter, which is reckoned one of the dearest houses, and we found every accommodation excellent, and their charges very moderate. Here are a number of Jews, who principally live in one street, called Jews-street, and a great many prostitutes of the lowest class, who always have a plentiful harvest in time of war, from the wages and prize-money of unwary sailors.

Helen's at eleven; hut the wind proving contrary, and the weather wet and hazy, we returned to St. Helen's Road, and came to anchor there in the evening. At seven the next morning, we weighed, and made sail. The weather during this, and the two following days, was moderate, and the winds variable. On board the King George were several ladies, who were going to Guernsey on a jaunt of pleasure ; and a cutter, from Gosport, belonging to our owners, accompanied us for the purpose of bringing them back. On the 19th, in the evening, we were at anchor with what is called the kedge, (which is one of the small anchors) and the cutter was moored to our stern with a stout rope ; but though the weather was very moderate, the tide run' so strong, that the rope presently broke, and the cutter ran adrift : the fluke of our anchor was likewise carried away ; this, however, was attended with no great inconveniency. Though I am so young a sailor, yet I had already been in some danger, as thou mayest recollect when we had a heavy gale of wind off Beachy; and I was again destined to be in a much worse situation, from quite a contrary cause, viz. a calm. This, to one like thee, will seem a paradox, as you people who never saw salt water must needs think it the best weather when the sky is clear, and the water smooth. On the 20th, in the afternoon, we saw the Casketts, which are a heap of rocks, so called by sailors, on account, I suppose, of their likeness. These rocks have been, perhaps, more fatal to mariners, than ever were the famed Scylla and Charibdis of the ancients. The tide drifted us right upon them : we were quite becalmed, so that our vessel was unmanageable; and at eight in the evening, they were within little more than a mile of us : we had soundings indeed in eighteen or twenty fathom water, but the bottom was nothing but sharp rocks, so that had we been reduced to the neces- sity"}, {"page_label": "Seite 45", "page_text": "NORTH-WEST COAST OF AMERICA.

This circumstance will at once strew thee, that cairns^ when near land, are oft times more dangerous than violent gales of wind. On the 21 st, about one o'clock, our owners brought us a pilot on board (the harbour of Guernsey being right a-head of us) to take us in; and it was rather a laughable circumstance, that the man pretended he could not speak any Englisti, and we had nobody on board who understood French; but we soon found Monsieur knew something of English, when he understood, that if he was ignorant of our language, we must provide ourselves with another pilot. We came to anchor in Guernsey Road about six o'clock in the evening, the weather wet and hazy. Thou wilt expect me to say something about this place, and I shall give thee every information in my power with the greatest pleasure, though my account will be much more circumscribed than I could wish ; notwithstanding .this, thou mayest be assured, that for the sake of swelling my narrative, I never will forsake the regions of truth, or overleap the bounds of probability. On a rock entirely surrounded by water, about three quarters of a mile from the town, stands the Castle, but its appearance has nothing of that Gothic cast, which edifices of that kind generally have; it is exceeding low, and I fancy very ancient, the greater part having been recently repaired, which makes it look like a piece of patch-work. It is defended by a number of guns, and a guard of soldiers ; but what quantity of each I cannot inform thee. It is likewise the prison for all the island, either in civil, or criminal cases.

Guernsey is situated on the side of a pretty steep hill, with a stony, or rather rocky bottom : it consists of several streets, which are dark, narrow, and inconvenient, but always clean, not only on account of their hard bottom, but also their declivity; so that any dirt or filth is always washed away by the last shower of rain. The houses in general are built of a coarse kind of free-stone, and seldom appear commodious, but never elegant : indeed convenience alone seems to have been principally attended to, even in the most modern ones. The island, I believe, is not very populous, and most of the inhabitants are brought up to a sea-faring life; so that the place, not affording every necessary of life in plenty, may, perhaps, be owing to proper want of cultivation, more than its natural sterility. This inconvenience is little felt, as the Guernsey cruisers being always on the coast of England, (whose fertile plains so amply reward the careful farmer's toil) bring back every .thing they want at a cheap rate. The merchants who reside at Guernsey are pretty numerous, and some of them considerable. In time of war, they fit out a number of privateers, and, in general, are pretty successful; but I am inclined to think, that a love of gain prompts them to these undertakings more than love of their country. In regard to their trade, it is chiefly of the contraband kind, and that on a very extensive plan, not being confined to their neighbours, the French alone, but extending to Spain, Portugal, and the Streights.

I am rather of the fame opinion ; but I endeavour to reconcile these contradictions, by supposing that the text of scripture about \" rendering unto Caesar, &c.\" is left out of their edition of the bible ; and that liberty, property, and no excise, is the fundamental axiom of their Magna Charta. One benefit which they reap from their encounters with the myrmidons from the English customs is, that knowing they are acting contrary to law, their men become totally callous to the feelings of humanity, and being thus entirely divested of the milk of human kindness, they fight like devils; and this may, in a great measure, account for the great success the Guernsey privateers generally meet with. Wines, brandy, &c. &c. are the principal commodities they traffick in. These articles, thou well knowest, pay heavy duties in England, therefore are best worth their attention. Till lately the article of tea was a kind of staple commodity here, but Mr. Pitt's late bill having so greatly lowered the duties, it is no longer an object worth their attention. What few women I saw were very ordinary ; indeed it was no easy matter to tell what complexion they were. of, so liberally were they bedaubed with paint and powder. Their language seems to be a mixture of bad French, with a provincial dialect, which renders it unintelligible jargon to every body but themselves ; however,, the greater part of the people in town speak pretty good English.

On the ad, about noon, one of the people saw something at a distance, floating on the water 5 this immediately excited every one's curiosity, and we wished to have a nearer view of it, but having little or no wind, the strip would not obey the helm : we prepared to hoist out our boat, but the tackles for that purpose were not at hand. In this dilemma, several of the people wistred to jump over-board, in order to see what had so engaged our attention, and to save it if worth the trouble. At first Captain Dixon objected to this, for fear of sharks, or other accidents ; but there was no alternative, as the expected prize drifted from us every moment j so giving leave, two of the people were in the sea in a moment, and found it to be a large calk, entirely covered with a kind of shell-fish, called barnacles. They presently brought it along-side, and we hoisted it on board. There is no doubt but it had been in the water a long time, as the fisti were with difficulty scraped off, having nearly eat holes through the cask : on examination, it proved to be a hogshead of claret.

This island, so famous in the commercial, or I might rather fay, voluptuous world, for its wine, appears mountainous, but not disagreeably so, as the land slopes down by gentle declivities to the water's edge. The numerous vineyards teem with ripe clusters of the juicy grape, which seem to invite the pressure of the careful vintner: these are ever and anon intersected by various plantations of other kinds, together with convents, and other public edifices, dedicated to religious seclusion, which appear to be very numerous here, and put me in mind of Foote's Mother Cole, when she complains of the cruel villains \" immuring for life such sweet young things, &c.\" Funchall, the capital of the island, appears very full of places dedicated to public worship ; and the streets seem regular. With this thou must be contented, for I have no other opportunity of seeing it than through a perspective glass, at three miles distance. When I first began to write, I was not certain whether fortune would favour me with an opportunity of sending it from Madeira, but on our coming a-breast of this bay, we found here two of his Majesty's ships, bound for England; and we are now laying to, whilst the packets are getting ready.

An old Negro (a native of the Island) received us on the beach ; he could speak a little broken English, and on understanding our business, went along with us to the merchant's house, and proved very serviceable, for none of us knew a word of Portugueze, and he could speak no English, so that the old man served as an interpreter. We were received with great civility and politeness, and treated with some excellent Madeira, Capilaire, oranges, &c. We paid a guinea for each vessel, as a kind of port charge, and entered their names in a book kept for that purpose, together with their destination, and from whence they came. Captain Portlock agreed with . this gentleman for some beef, and a few other necessaries ; but our interpreter informed us, that the country people would furnish us with many things we wanted, on cheaper terms than this gentleman. On going to Praya we found a kind of market held there, a number of people being assembled from various parts of the Island, with different articles to sell, such as hogs, sheep, goats, fowls, turkies, &c. together with oranges, lemons, limes, cocoa-nuts, bananas, a few pine-apples, and small quantities of clayed sugar, which they make up in parcels like our baskets of salt.

Of their live stock, the hogs and turkies are by far the best; their goats and sheep being very thin and spare, and their bullocks (for so it seems they call them) not so large as an English year-old calf; yet so poor are the people, that none of them could furnish us with any beef, the merchant, it seems, being the only person here able to carry on that traffic.

This was a lucky circumstance for us, as English coin is not ~ current here ; however, it was necessary to have some cash, which we got by applying to the merchant, who exchanged our guineas- for Spanish dollars, giving us four dollars, equal here to five shillings each, for a guinea; so that the course of exchange here is . nearly fifteen per cent. against us. The best way for any Captain- who proposes to touch at this place for a supply of provisions, &c. would be, to bring a few articles of hard-ware, such as knives, , buckles, razors, &c. &c. these would fetch a good profit, and furnish him with whatever cash he might want.

The Fort and Castle (or rather the paltry ' places which serve as an apology for them) are situated on an emi- -nence, near half a mile from the water side, and commanded by a Captain, with a detachment of soldiers, sufficient, no doubt, to keep the island in proper subjugation, but surely unable to repel any foreign armament. Immediately behind this fortress, on a large plain, stands the Town of Praya, consisting of about fifty or sixty huts, standing at .a good distance from each other, and form a large quadrangle, where the market is held: near the center is a pile of stones, which"}, {"page_label": "Seite 57", "page_text": "NORTH-WEST COAST OF AMERICA. 25 which serve as a cross. These huts (for I can call them no better) 1785. are built with stones, without any cement, and are perhaps as poorly constructed, as the most miserable out-house belonging to an English farmer. They consist only of a ground-stoor, which is generally divided into two, or at most three rooms. Beds are a luxury not known in general here, the people deeping on mats: indeed I saw one at the merchant's before-mentioned, but scarcely a menial servant in England would sleep in it. The natives are blacks, and generally servants to the Portugueze, many of whom reside here. They profess the Roman Catholic religion, of which they seem very tenacious. One day when I was at Praya, the people were going to public worship, and, impelled by curiosity, I was posting to the chapel, in order to fee their method of saying mass ; but the Commander of the Fort happening to fee me, sent one of his soldiers to order me back. The Portugueze behave kindly to strangers, but, perhaps, this may proceed from interested motives, as we went to their houses to purchase fruit, &c. A good woman at one of the houses made me a mess of boiled Indian wheat, mixed up with goat's milk, and sweetened with sugar, much like a good English housewife's firmity : this she pressed me to partake of with so much good-nature, that I could not refuse eating, and found it a very agreeable mess. It might be imagined from the warmth of the climate, that the females are naturally amorous ; yet both the natives and Portugueze constantly resisted every solicitation of that kind from our gentlemen, though they enforced their rhetoric with very tempting presents : whether these constant denials proceeded from a real love of chastity, I sir all leave thee to determine.

I judge the soil to be much the same with that of tropical islands in general; indeed were it capable of improvement equal to that of England, the people are too lazy to cultivate it. I have before mentioned the principal articles this place produces. These in general require little or no labour, except the cultivation of Indian wheat, and the manufacturing the small quantity of sugar-cane which the island affords : from this they make a kind of spirit, which is here called rum, but by sailors aqua dente. This they make into punch, and render it palatable by infusing plenty of lemon, or lime-juice, and sugar. This island abounds with goats, and their milk seems to be a considerable part of the people's sustenance ; for I observed in all the huts I went into, bowls filled with it, and generally a number of cheeses. I am the more apt to believe this, as I could fee no preparations for cooking victuals in any of the houses, not even so much as a fire, though I visited many of them at different times of the day. The heat of the climate requires but little cloathing, and in this respect suits the purses of the inhabitants; for the few cloaths they have (the soldiers excepted) seem to be purchased at secondhand, from ships that touch here for refreshment. I ought not to include the women, however, (the fair sex I had like to have said) in this remark : t hey wear a loose wrapper, of cotton manufacture, the produce of the island, generally striped with blue, after various patterns, as their fancy suggests; this wrapper, with a light petticoat, and a cap, chiefly constitute the women's dress.

Having compleated every object we had in view at St: jago, and a favourable breeze springing up, we weighed anchor at ten o'clock in the morning of the 29th October, after taking leave, with three hearty cheers, of our good friend Captain Clarke, whom we left at anchor. We also left the ship belonging to Mr. Montgomery riding in the bay. The live stock we brought from the Isle of Wight being nearly expended, we had purchased several goats, tur- kies, and sheep here, in order to make our voyage more comfortable, and to preserve us from tire scurvy. I have already mentioned the great heat of the weather at St. Jago, and endeavoured, in some measure, to account for it. Thou may est easily imagine, that the nearer we approached the Equinoctial Line, the weather grew more intensely hot; and this is greatly increased by calms, which are very frequent in latitudes near the Line, whilst a fresh breeze always renders the heat more tolerable. On the zd November, being in eight degrees North latitude, and the weather most intensely hot, our people were busily employed in scrubbing and cleaning between decks, and every part of the vessel with care, and afterwards washed it well with vinegar. This method was always used by the late Captain Cooke, in his long voyages, and he ever found it attended with the happiest effects, in regard to the preservation of health. Such kind and humane attentions to the health of people under the care of any Commander, must certainly place his character, as a man and a Chrijiian ,"}, {"page_label": "Seite 61", "page_text": "NORTH-WEST COAST OF AMERICA. 2 - Christian , high in the estimation of every person of feeling and humanity. ' 78 * November.- Indeed I cannot help considering this attention as a duty absolutely incumbent on him ; for, if the master of a family on shore considers it his duty to take care of his servants during sickness, when they have it in their power to procure relief by various other methods, how much more does it behove the Captain of a slrip to bestow every attention in his power on his servants welfare ? In the midst of the wide ocean, to whom can they seek for succour ? They have no kind friend, no tender parent to apply to for relief ? No generous Public, whose charity they might implore, and who rarely sail to astist the helpless in their distress ! Yet notwithstanding these powerful motives, there are, I am afraid, too many Captains who do not trouble themselves about such (to them) trivial matters, but trust to chance for the health or sickness of their people.. From the 4th to the 12th of November, the weather was very variable ; sometimes it was clear, and nearly calm, and presently it would change to strong squalls and heavy rain, attended with constant thunder and lightning. I had omitted to mention, that on the yth the ship's company were served with peas, at an allowance of half a pint per man, for three days in the week : this\" addition to our salt pork, made a very comfortable mess. By the 13th we were in the latitude of 2 degrees North, and the weather grew more settled and favourable : we had a fresh Easterly breeze, with a clear sky, unattended with any sudden squalls, or thunder and lightning,.

It perhaps may be necessary to inform thee, that the method of ■ - . finding what latitude the ship is in is, to take an altitude of the Sun when he is in the meridian, (which is always twelve o'clock at noon) and this altitude, after being wrought by an easy process, gives the latitude. Sailors on crossing the Line, have a custom of plunging every person on board, who have never been to the Southward of it, over head and ears in a tub of water. This ceremony being but ill relished by some of our people, Captain vixen promised all hands a double allowance of grog if they would desist: this was very willingly accepted, and harmony was soon restored: but alas! grog and good humour soon w ere at variance, and some of the people grew so quarrelsome and turbulent, that they were put in irons : this brought them to reason in a short time, and they were set at liberty on promise of better behaviour.

On the 26th, tea and sugar were served to the ship's company, at an allowance sufficient for breakfast every morning. This made a very comfortable addition to our victuals, and was a very agreeable change : add to this, they are excellent anti-scorbutics, and as such, peculiarly desirable in long voyages. Indeed we had a plentiful stock both of tea, coffee, and sugar for our own mess, of a superior quality to- what we had served out; but it was a most desirable acquisition to the people, as I believe it is never served out, either in the King's ships, or merchants service. On the 30th, we had a spare mainsail fitted over the quarter-deck, as a temporary awning. This not only rendered the heat of the weather more tolerable on deck, but was of great use in preserving it from the sun. By the 6th of December we were well out of the Tropics, being, in 26 deg. 16 min. South latitude. The weather now began to be agreeable and pleasant, with fresh steady Easterly breezes. At nine in the morning of the 7th, the King George made a signal for seeing a sail to the South-West; but she did not come near enough; for us to discern what cpuntry she belonged to.

This forenoon our last goat died, being literally starved to death with cold, though we had taken every precaution in our power to keep her alive.

On the 1 st January, 1786, we had great numbers of seals and penguins about us, and a great variety of birds, which plainly indicated that we were not far from land. At three o'clock in the morning of the ad, we saw land, the extremes of which bore from South-East by South to South by West, at about nine leagues distance. At ten o'clock we sounded in seventy-eight fathom water, over a fine sandy bottom, intermixed with black specks: the extremes of the land at noon bore from South-East to South-West; the weather thick and hazy with rain. During the afternoon, we had light winds, inclining to calm. In the evening we sounded, and had again seventy-eight fathom water, with much the same bottom as before.

A.t eight o'clock in the evening, the Westernmost land bore West South-West, and the Eddystone North-East. We had frelh breezes, with thick hazy weather ; at times a thick fog. In the forenoon of the 4th we saw two small islands, bearing South by East and South by West, with high land behind them. At noon, the Westernmost land in sight was about four leagues, and the Easternmost near eight leagues distance, latitude 51 deg. 10 min. South. During the afternoon we stood along shore, as we judged Port Egmont (the harbour we intended to anchor in) not to be far off. About midnight, being within three miles of the Westernmost land, Captain Portlock made signal to stand off shore. I have before observed, that we had very long days ; in fact, we had no night, and the weather being moderate, might justly warrant our standing near the land during the night time.

Mr. Macleod left a copy of the various signals he was to make on board the Queen, as a guide for us, our vessel being a-head of the King George. At half past seven Mr. Macleod fired a mufquet, as a signal for danger, which occasioned us to stand off the land, and tack occasionally, the better to observe the motions of the boat.

At eleven o'clock both ships came to anchor in Port Egmont, in seventeen fathom water over a sandy bottom.

The principal object we had in view, was to water the sliips; for this we were situated very conveniently, as I have before observed. We had also found during our cruize, that the Queen was not sufficiently deep in the water; so that some hands were employed in fetching stones to put in the hold, by way of ballast. These employments were set about without delay, and both would have been compleated in three or four days at farthest, had we not been frequently interrupted by blowing squally weather: however, by the 14th, both these objects were entirely compleated, besides fresli stowing the hold. During this time all the people had been on shore to recreate themselves, land air being reckoned exceeding salutary and wholesome for sailors. On the 14th, the people were employed in setting up the rigging fore and aft, and other necessary business. On the 15th, an English sloop came to anchor in the harbour, and her boat going on board the King George, we learnt that sire belonged to a strip commanded by a Captain Hussey, called the United States, but Britisii property, which lay in Hussey Harbour, States-Bay, Swan-Isiand, in company with a strip from America. The United States was the property of Mrs. Hayley, relict of the late George Flay ley, Esq; and sister to the celebrated Mr, Wilkes. These vessels had been at Falkland's Islands occasionally for more than a year, and had wintered in Husiey Harbour before-mentioned ; so that they were perfectly acquainted with the tides, the currents, and in short every circumstance necessary for the safely navigating a ship in any of the various roads, bays, and sounds, so numerous here, 1786.

During the time our necessary business was carried on, both our Captains were employed in surveying the port, and various parts of the land. In one of these excursions, they fell in with a birth for the ships, greatly preferable to that we lay in, on the West side of the bay ; and as they proposed staying here a few days longer, it was determined to take the vessels there : so early in the morning of the 16th we unmoored, and at eight o'clock made fail : at ten we came to anchor in seven fathom water. We soon found that our situation was changed for the best, being well sheltered from the wind, and no swell to incommode us. 'Tis most probable that this was near the place where Captain Macbride lay in the year 1766, when he wintered here, as we found on the adjacent shore the ruins of several houses, said to be built by him, but destroyed since by the Spaniards. From the 16th to the 19th, the people of both ships were alternately on shore, to recreate themselves, land air (as I have already observed) being very salutary, and wholesome for people in our situations : indeed this place affords little refreshment of any other kind, as I shall take notice by and bye. Having learnt from Mr. Coffin, Master of the stoop, that there was a good passage for us through the* islands, and he kindly undertaking to lead the way as our pilot, our Captains determined to get to sea the first opportunity, as the season was already too far advanced for us to expect a good passage round Cape Horn. Accordingly we weighed anchor, and made fail early in the morning of the 19th of January.

In the morning of the 20th, we weighed and made fail, and came to anchor at noon in West-Point Harbour, in eight fathom water. , On the 21st, in the morning, we again made fail. Mr. Coffin cautioned us to be on our guard, in rounding West-Point, as the wind would pour upon us from the high land like a torrent. The morning was fine and clear, and the wind moderate ; yet luckily, we did not despise his precaution, but had all hands ready to clue up the fails; and well it was that we had, for before we got well round the Point, the wind poured down upon us like a hurricane, and continued to blow with amazing impetuosity for near an hour, during which time we durst not shew a single yard of canvas; but as we got clear of the high land, the wind grew moderate. At one o'clock we saw the two ships before-men- tioned, riding at anchor in Hussey Harbour; and at three o'clock we came to anchor in States Bay, Swan Island, off Elephant Point, in seventeen fathom water, and about a mile from the American vessels. Before I conclude, let me give thee as good an account of these Islands as I am able, from what observations I have made during our stay here. These Islands were first discovered by Sir Richard Hawkins, in j 594, but Captain Strong probably called them Falkland's Island, or more"}, {"page_label": "Seite 72", "page_text": "40 A VOYAGE TO THE 178s). January. more properly, Falkland's Islands, as there are a considerable number of them. It should seem as if the English proposed settling a colony here, by Captain Macbride's staying here a whole season, and erecting several houses: these, however, were destroyed by the Spaniards, who dispossessed us of the place in 1770. This affair made a great noise in London, and occasioned much clamour amongst the politicians at that time : but I shall fay no more on this head, as thou art much better versed in the political history of this place than myself; only just observe, that we need not wonder at the Spaniards envying us the possession of these islands, as their situation commands the passage to the Spanish Settlements in the South Seas. Port Egmont, (viz. that part of it where we last lay at anchor) is situated in 51 deg. 12 min. South latitude, and 59 deg. 54 min. West longitude, and is a most spacious harbour, perhaps large enough for all the strips belonging to Great Britain to ride at anchor. How far these islands extend, I cannot pretend to fay with any degree of certainty ; but I imagine more than one degree in latitude, and two degrees in longitude. The situation of Port Egmont seems to be nearly centrical; so by that, and the former conjecture, thou mayest form a pretty good idea of their extent. Though these islands are universally known by the name of Falkland's, yet many of them are called by different names, just, I presume, as the fancy of different cruisers have suggested : I just 1 men-"}, {"page_label": "Seite 73", "page_text": "NORTH-WEST COAST OF AMERICA. 4i mention this circumstance to prevent thy surprise, on seeing such 1786. names as Swan Island, Keppel's Island, &c. &c. January One would naturally suppose from the situation, that the climate here is much the same as that of England: this, however, seems far from being the cafe. Though this is nearly the height of \"■ Summer here, yet the weather is frequently cold and winterly, the thermometer being never higher than 53 deg. The winds have generally been westerly, with frequent squalls and heavy rain. The foil seems of a light, free nature, and well calculated for meadow or pasture land ; indeed in many places it is no easy matter to tell what nature the soil is of, for the vegetation has grown, and rotted, and grown again, till great numbers of large hillocks are formed, from the tops of which grow large blades of grafs; these naturally inclining to each other, form a kind of arch, and afford occasional retreats for seals, sea-lions, penguins, &c. &c. which abound here. Near the ruins of the town are a number of small pieces of ground, inclosed with turf, which, no doubt, were intended for gardens, as it might easily be perceived that they had been in a cultivated state. In one of them I found several sorts of flowers, and some fine horse-reddish. 'Tis something remarkable, that there grows not a tree, or any thing like it, on these islands : our people, after much searching, found some brusli-wood, but so small, that it would scarcely serve to make brooms for the ship's use. There are few or no insects to be met with here, though Mr. Hogan, Surgeon of the King George, who is a considerable proficient in Natural History, took infinite pains to procure some.

Our people were greatly elated on seeing them, imagining they should live luxuriously during our stay; but here they were grievously disappointed, for both geese and ducks eat exceedingly rank and fishy, owing, no doubt, to their constantly feeding on marine productions x so that they soon grew heartily tired of them as food, though the exercise of running them? down was both agreeable and healthy. Besides these, here are various other kinds of the feathered tribe,, the principal of which are the Port Egmont hen, (called the slcua- gull by Pennant) and the albatross. Pennant distinguishes the species found here by the name of the wandering albatross, though at what time of the year they migrate I cannot fay : however, I am certain that this is the time of their incubation, as I saw several hundreds of them setting on their nests, and great numbers of young scarcely fledged. The Port Egmont hen is a very ravenous bird, something like a hawk, only larger; they are very numerous here; indeed so are many other kinds, though it is not in my; power to particularize them. I shall, therefore, conclude this article with observing, that the only bird we caught here, which eat without any rank fishy taste, is called by sailors a feapie : this bird is not web-footed, but has claws much like our fowls, and subsists chiefly on worms, &c. seldom or never going far from the seaside. Our people frequently attempted to catch fish, but were always disappointed, so that we began to conclude these islands were not blessed with that capital part of the creation ; but Captain Hussey making us a present of some sine mullet, convinced us of our mis- 2 take."}, {"page_label": "Seite 75", "page_text": "NORTH-WEST COAST OF AMERICA. 43 take. It seems these are almost the only kind of fish found here, and they often caught them in large quantities. On many of the beaches are large beds of muscles and limputs, and various other marine productions, some of which serve as food for the penguins, geese, &c. &c. indeed there is no doubt but every one of them has its uses, as we are well assured, that the Almighty Creator of the Universe made nothing in vain.

Though the trade winds can seldom be depended on out of the Tropics, yet we were lucky enough to meet with a pretty regular trade in this latitude : this determined our Captains to steer for Los Majos, (an Island, or rather a group of Islands seen by the Spaniards, and laid down by them in 20 deg.

The latter end of this month we caught a , number of sharks : these are reckoned very coarse, rank food, and they.certainly are so; but to us, who had been so long on salt provisions, they were a prize, and by making a mess which sailors call chouder, of them, they eat very palatably. The weather was very hot and sultry, with frequent light airs, sometimes inclining to .calm. Prom the ist to the 3 d of May, we saw numbers of turtle, which gave us reason to hope that we should fall in with a turtle island, especially as Captain Cook, in his last voyage, fell in with one not , many degrees from us; but in this we were disappointed. With all our endeavours, we only caught one; but Captain Portiock was more lucky, owing to his whale-boat being fixed on the ship's quarter ; so that when they saw any turtle, his people could launch the boat, and be after them in a minute; by which means they caught from ten to fourteen per day, part of which was always sent on board us : so that though turtle was a kind of luxury, yet we began to be pretty well satiated with it : this relpite from salt provisions must, however, have been-of singular service to both ships companies.

From the nth to the 14th, we lay to every night, and when we made fail in the morning, spread at the distance of eight or ten miles, standing Westerly: it being probable that though the Spaniards might have been pretty correct in the latitude of these islands, yet they might easily be mistaken several degrees in their longitude: but our-latitude on the 15th, at noon, being 20 deg. 9 min.

I forgot to observe before, that our original destination was first to King George's Sound : but as we were considerably later in the season than we once expected to be, our Captains judged it most prudent to make Cook's River first, and stand along the coast to the Southward, as the season advanced. The wind being right against us, we plied to windward during the 17th and 18th, when we found the land seen on the evening of the 16th, to be a group of islands, called by Captain Cook the Barren Islands, and situated at the entrance of Cook's River.

We were so elated with this promising appearance, that an assortment of our various articles of trade was immediately got to hand, and abundance of furs were already on board, in our imagination : but these pleasing ideas soon vaniffied, for we soon found that these people belonged to the Ruffians. Though our expectations of finding inhabitants here were disappointed, yet as the place was found very convenient for procuring a supply of wood and water, every necessary preparation was made for that purpose, and parties sent on shore in the morning of the 20th, to cut wood and fill water : in the mean time, our Captains went in the King George's whale-boat to the Ruffian Factory, in order to pick up what intelligence they could, respecting their business on this coast.

However, the accounts we got seldom agreed, and gave us but an indifferent idea of their proceedings, though this might arise, in a great measure, from our having but a very imperfect knowledge of the Russian language : thus much we were pretty certain of, that they had met with very few, if any skins, though they had got nankeens, and Persian silks, to traffic with..

At noon on the 27th, the Burning Mountain bore South-West by West. A considerable smoke issued from its summit, which is very lofty, but we saw no firy eruption ; nor did I find, on enquiry of Captain Dixon, that they ever saw any greater appearance of a volcano from this mountain, during their cruize up this river, their last Voyage, at which time it was discovered. At three o'clock in the afternoon of the 28th, we came to anchor in eleven fathom water, over a sandy bottom, the adjacent coast to the Westward about three miles distance, tolerably level, and likely, in the opinion of our Captains, to produce Furs.

'Tis most probable this man came purposely to reconnoitre us, and learn our intentions ; for when he understood that we came to trade peaceably, and was strewn various articles we had to traffic with, he was very well pleased,[and gave us to understand that the people (pointing to the shore) would bring us plenty of skins by the next day's fun. Early in the morning of the 29th, we had several canoes along-side us ; some so small, that they hold only one or two men, and others with from ten to fourteen people in them : they brought us skins of various forts, such as land and sea otters, bears, racoons, marmotts, &c. &c. for which they took toes and blue beads, but the toes are held in the greatest estimation, a middling sized toe fetching the best otter skin they had got.

At five in the morning of the nth, we weighed anchor, and kept standing down the river. At eight o'clock we perceived two Ruffian boats, with eighteen men in each, steering for the island to the Southward. They, no doubt, were the fame people we saw in coming up the river.

In regard to the extent of this river, I cannot Ipeak with any degree of certainty; but we know that it reaches considerably farther to the Northward than where we lay at anchor. With respect to its breadth, it is seldom more than twenty miles over. The inhabitants seem not to have fixed on any particular spot for their residence, but are scattered about here and there, as best suits their convenience or inclination. 'Tis most probable they are divided into clans or tribes, as in every large canoe we saw, there was at least one person of superior authority to the rest, who not only directed their traffic, but kept them in a proper degree of subordination. In their manners they seem harmless and inoffensive ; but this might probably be occasioned by the different treatment they met with from us, to what the Ruffians had used them to.

One would reasonably suppose, that the stuns of large luguft.^ b ea fl.

Besides the sea-otter, here are bears, wolves, foxes, racoons, marmots, or field mice, musquash, ermine, &c. &c. but the marmot and fox seem to be in the greatest plenty. The trade these people are fondest of for their skins, is toes, and light blue beads, scarcely any other sort (though we had a very great variety) being taken the least notice of. In their persons, these people are of a middle size, ami well proportioned ; their features appear regular, but their faces are so bedaubed with dirt and filth, that it is impossible to fay what fort of complexion they have. That person seems to be reckoned the greatest beau amongst them, whose face is one entire piece of smut and grease, and his hair well daubed with the same composition. Their nose and ears are ornamented with beads, or teeth, if they cannot procure any thing else : they have likewise a long slit cut in the under lip, parallel with the mouth, which is ornamented much in the same manner with the nose and ears; but this I could observe was always in proportion to the person's wealth. We saw only one woman, and the people with her behaved with great civility, and attended her with great respect : her face,, contrary to the general custom, was tolerably clean, and her complexion and features far from disagreeable: indeed I have often seen much worse-looking women in England.

I have observed, that the afternoon of the 12th was fine, and the weather continuing favourable, we weighed anchor at four o'clock- in the morning of the 13th of August, having a fine leading breeze and clear weather. We stood down the river to the East North East, leaving the Barren Islands to the Southward. Before noon we were clear of Cook's River, and our destination being for Prince William's Sound, we stood to the North East, at about two leagues distance from the slrore.

Having had no meridian altitude since the 14th, we could not be exactly certain as to our situation, but concluded the land which we now saw to the North East to be Montague Island. It being nearly calm, and our soundings greatly lessened, we came to anchor at three o'clock, in forty- three fathom water, over a sandy bottom; distance from shore about three miles. I should observe, that for some days past our soundings had varied from one hundred and twenty to twenty- eight fathom water, generally over a muddy bottom. An island to the Northward bore from North East by East to North North East. Another point of land due North, at six miles distance. Whilst we lay at anchor, many of our people got out their fishing-lines, thinking we lay on a cod-bank; they caught some fculpins, and a few halibut, but were disappointed in their expectations of catching cod. The weather continued thick and foggy, but at six o'clock in the afternoon of the 1 8th, a breeze springing up from the South West by West, we weighed anchor, and stood in for the shore. At ten o'clock, we sounded with forty-five fathom line, over a bottom of sand mixed with shells; at twelve, we had no bottom with eighty fathom line.

The coast, indeed, formed a kind of bay, but afforded no place, in this situation, where a vessel could anchor, with any degree of safety. We sounded with a line of no fathom, but found no bottom, neither was the colour of the water in the least changed; so that there is reason to expect deep water quite close to the shore. Being disappointed in our expectations of falling in with Cross Sound, it was judged a needless waste of time to look for it in any other situation, especially as Captain Cook never came to anchor there, but only saw it at a considerable distance ; and we knew by experience, how deceitful the appearances of land are on this coast, occasioned by a constant haze, which perpetually changes its position, and renders it next to impossible to ascertain land at a distance, with any degree of certainty. The Bay of Ifands was the next eligible harbour for us to make; this lay about thirty miles to the Southward and Eastward.

The weather on the 17th grew moderate, and a fine Westerly breeze came on early in the morning : our latitude at noon was 55 deg. I 5 rmm North; and our longitude 136 deg. 14 min. West.

We saw a species of bird quite different from any we had hitherto seen : his make was long and slender, yet his flight was very heavy.

The claps of thunder were astonishingly loud, and the lightning so very fierce, that it blinded the people on deck for a considerable time, and every flalh left a strong sulphurous stench behind. I was upon deck during the greatest part of the storm; and I must own to thee, that the awful and tremendous appearance of the elements (if I may be allowed the expression) affected me greatly. How often have I thought, that nothing in nature could equal the thunder storm so beautifully described by Thomson, in his Seasons : but here, every awful situation in Thomson's picture was brought on the canvass in the most conspicuous point of view, and the majesty of the whole still heightened by the roaring of the wind, the raging of the sea, and a more than common darkness, which overspread the surrounding atmosphere. Towards fix in the morning the storm abated, and we again had light baffling winds, and a very heavy cross sea, which prevented us from standing in for the shore, especially as the morning was thick and hazy. At ten o'clock we saw the land, bearing from North West to East, about nine miles distant y but frequent calms, and a heavy swell setting right in shore, made us glad to keep from the land as much as possible, and more especially, as from the point of the harbour, and at least two miles from shore, there runs L reef of breakers, for two miles to the Northward.

Indeed it should be remembered, that the wind for some days past had been as favourable as we could wish, when at a distance from the shore, but always grew light and variable, as we drew near the land; and there is every reason to imagine this would have been the cafe at present: so that on the whole, we probably may have cause to rejoice at this unexpected determination.

Twice indeed, (viz. at Cross Sound, and the Bay of Islands) our miscarriage was owing, in a great measure, to misinformation ; and that we did not make either Prince William's, or Nootka Sound, may justly be attributed to unfavourable winds, and bad weather, things which must ever baffle the strongest efforts of human wisdom ; and, though we were unacquainted with Captain Portlock's motives for leaving the coast, yet he no doubt was convinced, that every attempt had been made that prudence could suggest, consistent with the safety of the vessels, or the lives of the people.

Davy's power is very great, but he is supposed to preside more immediately over the winds and waves, though he seldom or ever appears for any good purpose ; and this I presume makes the honest tars afraid of his Worship. 'Tis somewhat strange, that a set of men, who despise real dangers, which might appall the fioutejl heart, should be terrified with ideal fears of their own creating, and those raised by an object fit only for a bug-bear to children.

On the 5th of November, at noon, we were in 24 deg. 32 min.

This time of the year seems to be the stormy season near the Sandwich Islands; for though we had often strong gales of wind, yet they were never steady or lasting, but came on us suddenly, attended with impetuous torrents of rain. The weather on the 8th and 9th, was extremely sultry, with lightning almost in every direction, particularly in the evening of the 9th. About four o'clock in the morning of the 10th, we had a violent gust of wind, which lasted about half an hour, attended with exceeding heavy rain, which greatly contributed to render the atmosphere cool and pleasant. The scarcity of birds for many days past, was rather remarkable? and more particlarly so, as the Tropic birds are peculiar to the latitude we were in: indeed on the 9th, we saw one solitary man of war bird, and the same day caught two dolphins, with hook and line, which were the only fish we had been able to lay hold of since our leaving the Continent.

During the night, we stood to the West North West, under an easy sail ; and at seven in the morning of the 16th, Monakaah bore South 25 deg. West. A considerable space on its summit was covered with snow ; and I have every reason to think, that this mountain is never totally free. During the forenoon, we steered nearly West by South, about three miles distant from shore, with a fine Easterly breeze; but the sea running pretty high, no canoes ventured off to us. At two o'clock we saw Mowee, bearing North 70 deg. West, about seven leagues distant. The day being now very clear, we had an uninterrupted view of Monakaah, the highest land in Owhyhee.. This mountain, though undoubtedly very lofty, has nothing stupendous in its appearance, the ascent to it on all sides appearing gradual and easy. That part of the island which we now coasted along, is very beautiful. The land appears to be laid out in distinct plantations* every one of which seemed in a high state of cultivation. The higher grounds are covered with trees, which yield a never-failing verdure; and in three or four places, there are abrupt breaks in the land. These chasms being well supplied with plentiful streams of fine water, render the landscape truly delightful. As Karakakooa Bay had been found, on several accounts, an improper place to anchor in, it was determined to examine another bay, which lay round the South West.

So eagerly did they pursue this profitable traffic, that they seldom washed their vessels, and we unavoidably got taro pudding mixed among the water; but we found it of little or no prejudice, though the fight would perhaps not have been altogether pleasing to an epicure.

If I remember right, I'mentioned the taboo when we were last at the Islands; I shall now only just observe, that its operation is very extensive, and regards not only places, but food, and, in short, every action of. life. In the afternoon of the ist, we had frequent squalls, attended^, with a good deal of rain.

To the credit of the men be it spoken, they looked on them as things of no value ; but the females saw them in a very different point of view, and were exceedingly fond of wearing them. round their wrists and ancles as bracelets, calling them Booboo, and sometimes Poreema. As gallantry is perhaps equally prevalent here, as in more civilized nations, the men frequently preferred buttons to nails (contrary to their better judgment) in their traffic.

The King is a good-looking man, and appears about forty-five or fifty years old: he is tall, straight, and well-made, but his eyes seem rather weak, and affected with a kind of rheum; but whether this is owing to disease, or a temporary cold, I cannot fay. None of the Chiefs had any thing striking in their appearance, though it was easy to fee that they were above the common rank. The King's nephews were by far the finest men we had yet seen at any of the islands : they are not brothers. Piapia, the elder, being, if we understood right, son to the King of Atoui; and Myaro, the younger, son to a sister of Teereteere. Piapia is about five feet nine inches high, straight, and well proportioned ; his legs and thighs very muscular, his step firm, and rather graceful; and there is a dignity in his deportment which shews him to be a person of the first consequence. His countenance is free and open, but rather disfigured by the loss of three fore teeth, which, as I understood, were broke for the loss of a relation, it being the custom here for the Arees, or Chiefs, to part with a tooth at the death of a friend; his legs, thighs, arms, and various parts of his body, are tattooed in a very curious manner. Myaro is nearly as tall as his cousin, but cast, (if I may be allowed the expression) in a more delicate mould : he walks erect and stately, and his step is very graceful and majestic. It would, I think, baffle the united powers of a Wilton, Bacon, and Roubiliac, to equal the exact symmetry and sine turn of his legs and thighs, 1 or -V"}, {"page_label": "Seite 139", "page_text": "99 NORTH-WEST COAST OF AMERICA. or indeed his whole body; exceedingly prepossessing. in short, his figure has something in it 1786. Dec ember. Teereteere, having satisfied his curiosity for the present, and Captain Dixon presenting him with some beads, and other trifles, left us about two in the afternoon ; and we soon felt the good effects of his visit, the inhabitants bringing hogs and vegetables in much greater plenty than before, though from the little respect they seemed to pay him, we were led to suppose, that his influence over them was not great; in this point, however, we were mistaken. To lead thee regularly to a circumstance, which I am now going to mention, it will be necessary to refer so far back as our fitting out. When we left England, the quantity of coals our veslel was supplied with was very inadequate to a voyage like our's, though they were constantly used with the most scrupulous care. As Falkland's Islands afforded no wood, the Coast of America was the only place where we could procure any. Fully expecting to touch at several harbours, and perhaps winter in King Oeorge.s Sound, what wood we got in Cook's River was soon expended. It cannot be forgot, under what circumstances, and with what reluctance, we left the American Coast; and the more, as fuel was one of our greatest wants; for though we knew Sandwich Islands afforded most of the necessaries of life in great plenty, yet we almost despaired of getting a supply of fuel; but in this respect were most agreeably disappointed 3 for we no sooner made the natives understand"}, {"page_label": "Seite 140", "page_text": ",IQD 1786, December. .-A l VOY A G E T O THE stand what we wanted, than they-brought us plenty of wood, such as answered our purpose extremely well, and which we purchased -on the same easy terms as the water. During the 5th and 6th, we were all very busily employed; some taking in wood from the natives; others over-hauling the rigging, Sec. and the rest killing and salting hogs for sea-store. The weather since the ist has been fine and settled, with a steady breeze at North North East. From the 7th to the 10th the wind blew fresh, at East North East; and the sea running pretty high, very few canoes came near ■us. This weather, however, did not prevent the King and his attendants from paying us frequent visits; but it was very apparent that interest, more than curiosity, induced him to come on board so often; for though he always brought something, by way of a Matano, or present, yet it was generally very trivial, such as a small hog, a few cocoa-nuts, and sometimes a few small barbel; and Captain Dixon always gave him ten times the value. Indeed it would have been extremely impolitic not to have paid him this mark of our respect and attention, as he could, by tabooing the inhabitants, have easily prevented a single canoe from coming near us; but by thus feeding his avarice, and gratifying his ambition, he not only allowed, but encouraged the people to bring us whatever the island afforded. The wind still continued at East North .East; the weather moderate and fine. Soon after we came to anchor, our whale-boat was hoisted out, to be in readiness whenever occasion required ; and was generally secured by her painter to the ship's stern.

On this, Captain Dixon fired two musquets over their heads, which made them sheer off with precipitation, and we got her on board next day, for fear of a second visit of the like nature. In the forenoon of the 12th, we caught a large shark, and knowing it would be a very acceptable present to the King, Captain Dixon sent to inform some of his people who happened to be on board the King George of it. Teereteere presently sent his son, with several attendants, J in a large canoe, for the shark, which seemed to please them very much. The King sent a fine hog by his son, as an equivalent for our present; but the young man, with a degree of honesty peculiar to his country, fold us the hog for a large toe. The last time we were at Whahoo, in sailing from thence to Atoui, we passed a bay to the Westward of our present situation, which promised to afford a good harbour; the surrounding country fertile, and full of inhabitants. At that time we had no opportunity of examining it, but now, having sufficient leisure, on the 13 th Captain Pordock sent his long boat, (which had been decked, and schooner-rigged, since we came to Whahoo) with Mr. Hay- ward, his Third Mate, accompanied by our Third Mate, Mr, White, to survey the bay accurately.

Except the affair of the whale-boat, we had discovered very few thefts; but this, doubtless, has been owing to our keeping the vessel as clear of the natives as possible, more than their honest disposition, which we are assured is not at all to be depended on.

A MONGST the few visitors we admitted on board, (besides the King, and his attendants) was an old priest, who seemed to have considerable authority amongst the natives. He always brought two attendants with him; one purposely to prepare his Ava, and the other to be always near his person, whenever he should be wanted. The Ava is a root, somewhat resembling our liquorice in shape and colour, but totally different in taste.

The delicious beverage is now compleat, and is 4 rank with the highest relish. This root is of an intoxicating nature, but seems to stupify, rather than exhilirate the spirits. Its effects are very pernicious, if we may judge by the old priest, who appeared greatly emaciated, - and his body was covered with a white scurf, which had the appearance of the leprosy. The wind still kept at North East, and East North East ; but from the 13th to the 16th, a very heavy swell set into the bay from the South East, which caused the vesiel to roll very much. On the 14th, we perceived the natives very busily employed on the hill, at the South East extreme of the island j and by noon on the 15th, their work was so far advanced, that we could plainly discern they were erecting a house, though the distance from us was very considerable. The same afternoon, all the canoes left both ships, and not one returned in the evening, which, till now, had never been the case; for, as an'intercourse with women was allowed, (indeed it could not easily be prevented) our people never failed to have a number on board every night. This made us suspect, that the people were tabooed; and our conjectures proved to be right, for during the whole of the 16th, not a single canoe appeared in the bay; but the summit of the mountain round the new erected edifice, was perfectly crowded with people the whole day j 1"}, {"page_label": "Seite 144", "page_text": "A VOYAGE TO THE, De 786 b da ^ ; and * n Evening, a number o£ fires were lighted as near * -.-J the place as the wind would permit. In the morning of the 17th, we were in the fame quiet situation not a canoe to be seen, but the hill seemed pretty well cleared of its visitants. About ten o'clock in the forenoon, a man who was a stranger to us, came on board, bringing with him a very small pig, as a present, and a branch of the cocoa-palm to fix at the mast head. This made us hope that the taboo was taken off, and the more, as all our hogs and vegetables were consumed. Soon afterwards our old acquaintance the priest paid us a visit, bringing a few trifles, as usual, by way of present, and for which he always got five times the value. We had strongly suspected this old man to be the cause of the taboo, as he left the strip on the 15th, seemingly much dissatisfied with something or other, and had not been near us till now; but we were convinced, that our conjectures were ill-founded, though he gave no satisfactory account of the recent transactions on shore; but kept repeating with great vociferation, and for a considerable length of time, \" Teereteere poonepoone , Teereteere ar re our a\" or that the King was a liar, scoundrel, and deceitful person; Poonepoone and arreoura , being terms of reproach. From this it was evident, that something had been tram- sacting contrary to established custom, or the rules of the country. About noon, Teereteere came on board, bringing his usual present of a hog, some fish, and a few cocoa-nuts. A number of canoes now came along-side, from whom we bought a few hogs and vegetables, but could obtain no satisfactory account from any of them why the taboo was laid on. Some of them gave us to understand, that there had been a solemn festival at the top of the mountain ; and, if we understood right, a human sacrifice offered, but whether * a man"}, {"page_label": "Seite 145", "page_text": "NORTH-WEST COAST OF AMERICA. a man or woman, we could not learn. The women, how, were still tabooed, and none suffered to come near the ships. rc>5 About midnight, our small bovver-cable parted in a sudden gust of wind, on which we let go the best bower. On heaving in the cable, we found it very much hurt, which we suspected to be done by the foulness of the bottom. The former part of the 18th was spent in searching for our anchor, which we did not find till noon, the buoy being sunk. No time was lost in attempting to get it on board; and about six in the afternoon, we had nearly effected our purpose, when a sudden squall coming on, snapt the hauler which we had bent to that part of the cable remaining to the anchor, when it was almost at the bows. This was a vexatious circumstance,'and we were afraid that the recovering our anchor would be attended with difficulty, as the evening was lowering, and seemed to forebode tempestuous weather; but as night came on, the Iky cleared up, and the next morning proved fine, with little or no wind, so that we got the anchor on board by eleven o'clock. We now were supplied with hogs and vegetables, in tolerable plenty, but no women were suffered to come on board the ships: the reason for this, we understood was, a woman had been detected eating pork on board one of the vessels. It seems the women are always tabooed from eating pork on shore, and breaking through restrictions of this fort, is reckoned a crime of the first magnitude ; nay, we were assured, that the poor wretch had fallen a victim to the laws of her country, and had actually been offered as a sacrifice, to appease, I suppose, the wrath of their gods, for so heinous a crime. But besides this affair of the sacrifice, there was O another 4"}, {"page_label": "Seite 146", "page_text": "io6 1786. December. A VOYAGE TO THE another motive, it seems, for the large concourse of people we had so lately seen at the top of the mountain, and which accounts for the strict taboo laid on the natives, during the time of this general assembly. Teereteere had caused the house I have mentioned at the top of the hill, to be built as a kind of repository, or store-house, for such articles as the natives might obtain, in the course of their traffic with our vessels : when this was compleated, he caused the bay to he tabooed, and convened a general assembly of the inhabitants at the top of this mountain, directing them at the same time, to bring whatever trade they had got, that it might be deposited in his new- erected edifice. This being effected, he found means, on some pretext or other, to appropriate one-half of these stores to his own use. We now no longer wondered at the old priest venting his reproaches so very liberally, as it was pretty evident Teereteere had exerted his authority contrary to the rules of justice and equity. Though the little we saw of these transactions, or what information we got respecting them, is insufficient for me to draw any conclusive' determination as to their laws; yet of this we are certain, that the horrid custom of offering up human sacrifices, on certain occasions, actually exists amongst these islands, and that the King's authority is absolute. It was evident, from our late misfortune, that we could not keep our present situation without damaging the cables; so that it was determined to leave this island, and steer for Attoui the first opportunity.

At five o'clock in the afternoon of the 19th, Captain Portlock 1786. made the signal for weighing anchor, which we did in a short ^ cem _ ^ time, and stood out of the bay with a moderate easterly breeze. After standing on for some time, we could see nothing of the King George following us, on which we wore, and stretched again into the bay. On speaking Captain Portlock, we were informed that they had not yet purchased their anchor, and were doubtful whether they should be able to accomplish it in the course of the evening. However, we kept under an easy sail, making short boards, till past eight o'clock, when Captain Portlock made the signal for us to anchor. About ten o'clock in the morning of the 20th, the King George being a-weigh, we weighed and made fail, standing out of the bay, with a moderate breeze at North East. By noon we were about ten miles from the bay. We learnt from Captain Portlock, that the Indians had cut his best bower-cable which had occasioned his. delay the preceding evening, and this morning. Captain Portlock had Piapia, the King's nephew, on board, accompanied with the man who used to chew Ava for Teereteere.' It seems Piapia was so exceedingly attached to Captain Portlock, that he was determined to go with him to Pritane, as they call England; and the cupbearer was inclined to follow the fortunes of his young master. The day being fine, several canoes, filled with the relations and friends of these new voyagers, followed the King George to a considerable distance from Whahoo ; and when they took their leave of them for ever, as they thought, their grief was expressed in the most audible manner, wringing their hands, and making the most bitter lamentations all the time they were in sight of the vessel : neither did Piapia, and his servant take leave of their friends and country, without expressing some degree of concern ; but their regret S"}, {"page_label": "Seite 148", "page_text": "A VOYAGE TO THE 1786. regret was less at present, as their attention was, in a great mea- L ^ sure, taken up with the novelty of their situation. We had light baffling winds, till the evening of the 21st, when a strong breeze came on at North East, which brought us in fight of Atoui, in the morning of the 22c!. At noon our latitude was 22 deg. 12 min. North j the East point of land bore East North East, about stx miles distant from shore.

About three o'clock, Captain Portlock let go his anchor, and we having bottom in twenty-five fathom, and at a convenient distance from the King George, prepared to do the fame, which, though we did with all expedition, and veered out fifty fathom cable, the anchor did not bring us up : this made us conjecture that we had drove off the bank, and our opinion was confirmed on heaving the lead over, as we found no bottom with eighty fathom line. Whilst our anchor was purchasing, we unavoidably drifted to leeward, so that it was impracticable to make the situation we first intended. On this we made several boards, and about five o'clock came to in a very good situation, near three miles North West of the King George, in eighteen and half fathom water, over a sandy bottom, inclining to mud.

A TOUI was the first place Captain Cook anchored at, when these islands were discovered by him ; so that it was known to afford great plenty of hogs and vegetables: the former we wanted to cure for sea-store, as the hogs we had bought since our leaving Owhyhee afforded us little more than a daily supply. Early in the morning of the 23d December, we were surrounded by a number of canoes, most of them well loaded with taro, potatoes, sugar-cane, and cocoa-nuts, and a good number os,fine hogs. This plainly (hewed us, that the inhabitants knew we were come for a supply of provisions, and had prepared themselves accordingly.

J bought the largest hogs for one large, or two middling-sized toes. On our asking for water, they presently brought us some very excellent, indeed the best by far we had hitherto met with. This kind of traffic was entirely new to them, and they very gladly supplied us on the same easy terms we bought it for at Whahoo. Cocoa-nuts we found in the greatest plenty; the settled price for them was five for an eightpenny nail. The sugar-cane was exceeding fine, and equally cheap. The taro here is by far the finest of any we met , with, and very plentiful; we commonly got five ' fine roots for an eightpenny or tenpenny nail. This island produces no yams, and very little, if any bread-fruit. The weather till the 27th was moderate and fine j but on that day, a strong breeze sprung up at East North East, and a heavy swell set in from East South East, right along shore : we were moored with the stream-anchor, and rode much easier than at Whahoo ; besides, the bottom here being free from rocks, we were under less anxiety in regard to our cables. The 28th, and part of the 29th, were wet and dirty; but towards evening, the sky brightened up, and the weather grew moderate and sine. This being Christmas, that season of the year so universally convivial throughout the civilized world, we spent our time as agreeably, and with plenty of as good chear as we could procure, ' such as roast pig, sea-pie, &c. &c. and to shew our refined taste, even in our liquor, we no longer drank grog mixed with simple water, but offered our Christmas libations in punch, mixed with the"}, {"page_label": "Seite 151", "page_text": "11 r NORTH-WEST COAST OF AMERICA. i the juice of the cocoa-nut, toasting our friends and mistresses in 1787. bumpers of this liquor, which, perhaps, pleased more on account ,J ar ^ ar >j jf of its novelty, than from any other circumstance. * The weather seldom continued settled for more than a day together ; strong breezes at East North East, with a heavy South East swell, frequently intervening. By the 4th of January, 1787, we had salted and packed five puncheons of pork for sea-store; but hogs now grew rather scarce, not that we supposed the scarcity real, but owing to some scheme or other of the petty Chiefs. We had for some time expected a visit from the King, and been given to understand, that his presence, like a cornucopia, would teem with plenty; but his Majesty had not as yet thought proper to favour us so far. Abbenoue, the Chief, whom we met with at Onehow last year, was generally on board the King George, and being attached to Captain Portlock, caused plenty of fine hogs to be sent him ; but at present we found very little of his influence reach on board our vessel. From the 5th to the 9th, the weather was in an unsettled state, the wind frequently shifting to the Westward, but seldom blew from that quarter twelve hours together, and then only a moderate breeze. During this time, we were daily visited by the natives, who kept bringing us a few hogs, with taro, cocoa-nuts, &c. but barely sufficient to supply us from hand to mouth. Besides this traffic, which was carried on for necessaries, the natives had a brisk trade for curiosities of various kinds, such as cloaks,"}, {"page_label": "Seite 152", "page_text": "112 A VOYAGE TO THE 1787. January. cloaks, caps, mats, fishing-lines and hooks, necklaces, &c. &c. I probably may attempt to describe them at a future opportunity. They likewise brought great numbers of beautiful bird-ikins, in excellent preservation : these were generally made up in parcels of ten each, by a wooden skewer run through their beaks. On our wishing to procure some of them alive, we soon found plenty of bird-catchers, and the living birds were fold nearly as cheap as the preserved ones : they are near the size of a robin, the breast and throat of a most beautiful lively red, with a long beak, the wings and back a deep brown. I am informed by Mr. Hogan, Surgeon of the King George, who I before observed to thee, has studied Natural History, that they are a species of the, humming-bird. These birds being purchased by us with great avidity, the natives were induced to bring every thing of the kind they could lay hold of, among which was a species of wild-duck. Captain Dixon, on seeing them, concluded the island afforded plenty of game, and being fond of shooting, took two or three opportunities of going on shore with his gun, attended only by a servant, in one of the Indian canoes. The man to whom the canoe belonged had been very assiduous in bringing off water, and such other articles for our use, as were in his power; indeed he had been greatly noticed by many of us, and treated kindly, particularly by Captain Dixon, on account of the great resemblance he bore to one of our people: the man seemed highly sensible of the preference given to him before bis neighbours, and was not a little proud of his new office. The first time our Captain went on shore, he was apprehensive that the natives, by crowding about him, would spoil his diversion; but he found himself agreeably mistaken. Curiosity was excited in a much less degree here than at Whahoo; instead of being surrounded by crowds of idle, inquisitive gazers, the people generally 1 stuck"}, {"page_label": "Seite 153", "page_text": "NORTH-WEST COAST OF AMERICA. stuck close to whatever employments they were engaged in, such as 1787. manufacturing cloth, making lines, ropes, &c. so that he traversed J an \" ar y^ the country with as much ease, as he could have done in England. Contrary to his expectation, he did not find game very plentiful, yet never returned without some spoils of the field, such as ducks, terns, a species like our water-hen, and various other kinds. By this time, the wood we procured at Whahoo began to grow short, on account of the constant fires we were obliged to keep for heating water to scald hogs, and various other purposes. On this we applied to the natives for some, though without any sanguine hopes of our application being successful, as the mountains where the woods grow are farther up the country on this island, than at any of the others ; however, our application was very successful, the natives to a man engaging in this traffic, and every individual bringing us more or less of the article we wanted, though it was evident, from many poles and rafters brought for sale, and which had been recently pulled out of the ground, that their fences, and perhaps houses, had been demolished for our accommodation, and I may say, their profit; yet this proceeding serves to shew, that any thing whatever this island, or indeed any of the group affords, may easily be obtained, so great is the value they set on iron. The weather continuing unsettled, and the supply of vegetables being insufficient to serve us daily, it was determined to make Oneehow the first opportunity: so early in the morning of the 10th January, Captain Portlock made the signal for weighing anchor. I have before observed, that he lay farther out at sea than we did, so that he was favoured with a good Easterly breeze, at the same time we were becalmed, and could not possibly answer his signal.

Captain Portlock came to anchor pretty near his old situ- ation. At five o'clock in the morning of the nth, a strong breeze springing up at East South East, we weighed and made sail, standing directly for Oneehow; the breeze continued during the forenoon, with thunder, lightning, and rain. At noon, the West end of Atoui bore North 21 deg. East, seven leagues distant; and the high land on the South end of Oneehow, South 70 deg. West. We fully expected to have anchored at Oneehow by three o'clock, but before that time, the wind veered to the Westward, which made it impossible for us to attempt it. From the nth to the i8th, we had fresh Westerly and Northerly breezes, light baffling winds intervening at times. On the 15th, the King George weathered the South point of . Oneehow ; and on the 16th, we lost sight of her, which made us conclude she had come to an anchor: our vessel being very foul, could not work to windward equal to the King George, so that we contented ourselves in plying between the islands, making longer or shorter boards, as circumstances required ; however, we could not help repining at our situation, when compared with that of our fellow-voyagers ; but the event shewed, that they were far from being in an enviable situation. During this time we took care to stretch well to the Southward and Eastward, a precaution which proved exceedingly necessary ; for on the 19th, a strong gale of wind came on at South West, with a very heavy cross sea, which continued till noon on the 21st. In"}, {"page_label": "Seite 155", "page_text": "NORTH-WEST COAST OF AMERICA. In the afternoon of the 20th, the weather being thick and hazy, 1787. we lost sight of land, and did not see it again till near noon on the , J aimar ^ 22d, when Atoui bore from North 15 deg. East, to North 55 deg. West; distant about four leagues. During this gale, we were under great apprehensions for Captain Portlock's safety, as his situation we knew must be a very critical one, no harbour at Oneehow affording the least shelter from a Southerly or Westerly wind. But at one o'clock on the 22d, we saw the King George, to our great satisfaction, bearing West by North, about three leagues distant. From her situation, it was evident, that she had failed round Oneehow, and we did not doubt but that she had been obliged, by the violence of the gale, to flip, or cut her cables, and run to sea. The wind continued westerly till the 25th, when it veered to South East, and soon afterwards to North North East ; this being favourable for us, and likely to continue from that quarter, we again stood for Oneehow, and in the evening of the 26th, came to anchor in Yam Bay, in twenty-nine fathom water, over a sandy bottom; the extremes of Oneehow bore from South East to North by West, a mile and half distant from shore; the Island Tahoora South 48 deg. West. During the 27th, the wind kept at North North East, but blew so fresh, that our situation was by no means an eligible one. Our principal motive in coming to Oneehow was, to procure a supply of yams, they being the only root this island affords, which will keep for any time; but the surf ran so high, that very few canoes ventured off to us.

Our fears for Captain Portlock during the gale, were but too well founded; he had been reduced to the necessity of cutting his cables, and running to sea; and though he embraced the most favourable opportunity of doing this, yet he had barely room to weather the breakers at the North point of the bay.

Abbenoue is of a middle size, and appears to be about fifty years old: when we first saw him at Oneehow, his body was almost covered with a white scurf, and his eyes seemed weak, occasioned by an immoderate use of the Ava; but he then discontinued the drinking it at our request.

Besides the friendly offices of Abbenoue and Tyheira, we had frequent visits; from two other Chiefs, who frequently supplied us with hogs and vegetables; their names were Toetoe, and Nomaitahaite; but the latter was always known by us under the denomination of Long- shanks, from his being remarkably tall and thin, and his legs and thighs appearing too long for his body. Toetoe is well advanced in years, and appears greatly debilitated by the immoderate use of Ava, but unlike Abbenoue, he cannot form a resolution to leave it off. He appears to possess a very large portion of taro plantations,, and supplied us with larger quantities of that root, than any of the other Chiefs, and was always perfectly satisfied with whatever was offered him in return.

Captain Dixon made her a present of a bead Eraie , or necklace, with which she was wonderfully pleased. The attention and tenderness strewn to this little girl, so totally different from what we had hitherto seen, gave us an idea of the manner in which the female children of the Arees are treated, and may serve to throw some light on the general character of these people. For some days we were supplied by the Chiefs I have just mentioned, with a few hogs, taro, &c. sufficient, as they thought, for our daily consumption; none of the petty Chiefs, or common people coming near us. Abbenoue informed us, that the people were tabooed, and that nobody durst bring any thing to fell, not even water, till the King had paid us a visit, which he proposed to do very shortly. We never could learn the true cause of this taboo being laid on, and which it seems did not extend to the principal Chiefs; though if we compare it to the fame situation at Whahoo, under similar circumstances, there is good reason, to suppose, that it is done in order to exact some tribute or acknowledgment from the people, for the privilege of trading with us."}, {"page_label": "Seite 161", "page_text": "> NORTH-WEST COAST OF AMERICA. On the 5th of February, the King paid us his promised visit. He came in a large double canoe, attended by a number of Chiefs, exclusive of the men who paddled the c^noe. Amongst the attendants was Piapia, who, I informed thee, Captain Portlock brought from Whahoo. It seems Piapia had taken such a liking to his situation, that he was determined to stay at Atoui, and had entirely given up his intention of going to Pritane. Indeed Captain Portlock guessed this would be the cafe, and on that account the more readily brought him from Whahoo. His desire to leave his native country originated, no doubt, from a love of novelty ; and this love of novelty, or variety, call it which thou wilt, shews itself amongst young people, in a greater or less degree, in the most civilized part of the world. 121 1787.

The keen edge of this novelty was a good deal wore off, before we anchored at A toui, and when Piapia went on shore there, and found himself in the midst of his friends and relations, whom he had not seen for a considerable time, some of them perhaps not at all, 'tis no wonder that the little predilection he now had for his new voyage, was entirely destroyed; and that he should resolve to take up his abode with his former friends.

Before his Majesty left the vessel, Captain Dixon made him a present of a few toes, and some beads, which pleased very much, and he told us the taboo should be taken off, and the people suffered to trade with us as before. He was as good as his word, and in a day or two, things were in their former channel, the natives bringing us hogs, taro, sugar-cane, cocoa-nuts, plantains, water, curiosities, &c. as usual.

We assured him there would be quite sufficient for us all, which seemed to please him greatly ; and he cautioned us not to walk too far, as dinner would be ready by twelve o'clock : this he explained by pointing to the fun ; after which, Abbenoue left the management of the feast to Tyheira, as he wanted to be on board the ships. Having frequently heard our people who had been on shore speak of a village, called by the natives A Tappa, where a great number of people were commonly employed in manufacturing cloth, curiosity prompted me to walk to that place first, as I found it was not more than three miles distant, so that I could easily get back by Tyheira's dinner-time. Great numbers of the inhabitants crouded about us, when we first landed, but our people walking different ways, just as fancy or inclination led them, the natives were divided into different parties, and I was very little incommoded in my walk.

So far, the space from the beach to the foot of the mountains, is about two miles in breadth ; but from hence to A Tappa, it grows gradually narrower, till it terminates in a long sandy point, which I have already observed, is the West extreme of Wymoa Bay. A Tappa is a pretty large village, situated behind a long row of cocoa-nut trees, which afford the inhabitants a most excellent shelter from the scorching heat of the noon-day sun. Amongst these eocoa-trees is a good deal of wet swampy ground, which is. well laid out in plantations of taro and sugar-cane. I had laid my account in seeing their method of manufacturing cloth; but here I was mistaken ; a number of our people, prompted by the fame curiosity as myself, were got to A Tappa before me, where \" Labour stood suspended as we passed.\" The people stocked eagerly about us; some asking us to repose ourselves under the shady branches of trees planted about their doors; others running to the trees for cocoa-nuts, and presenting them to us with every mark of kindness and good-nature; in short, every inhabitant of the village was fully employed, either in. relieving our wants, or gratifying their curiosity in looking at us. \" Whilst a party of us were busied at the door of one of these kind strangers, I heard a rattling of stones, as if thrown with violence 1 ; 1 and"}, {"page_label": "Seite 166", "page_text": "126 A VOYAGE TO THE 1787- and at the same moment all the natives ran away from us with pre- edrusr) . c jpj|- at j on Q n turning about, I saw Tyheira coming towards us; it seems he was afraid that the people would be troublesome by ■crouding about us, and on that account he took this method of ■driving them away. This was the most convincing proof I had hitherto seen, of the very great power the Arees have over the common people. Any of the stones thrown by Tyheira were at least sufficient to have lamed any one they might happen to hit; yet the natives bore it with the most patient submission. Tyheira informed us, that by the time we got back to our landing-place, dinner would be ready. For this piece of intelligence, we were obliged to him; but he presently lpoiled all, by soliciting very earnestly for a Matano: however, it was not worth while to refuse him, so he collected six or eight nails, which satisfied him. very well for the present.

On examining the grass, which in most places is higher than the knee, I found it not altogether of a rough coarse fort, but intermixed with various forts of flowers, together with different grasses, of the meadow kind ; so that I have no doubt, with proper management, it would make excellent hay. By the time I got on the beach, dinner was nearly ready, and a large house, which Ab- benoue had for stowing away his canoes, was appropriated for our reception.

There were no less than four servants concerned in this business ; one brought in a large calabash of water; another, a parcel of cocoa-nuts; a third, a bowl full of fine baked taro; and the lass, usliered in by Tyheira himself, brought the hog, laid very decently on a large circular wooden dish. This done, the last man, who appeared to be the head cook, poured some water over the hog, and rubbed it with his hands, letting us understand, that by this means he should make excellent gravy. This part of the ceremony we could well have dispensed with, but it could not be avoided, without offending our host; and indeed our appetites, at this time, were not remarkably delicate; for my own part, I eat an exceeding hearty dinner, and I believe most of the party followed my example. All this time, Tyheira's attendants were ready to open cocoa-nuts for us, whenever we required to quench our thirst, and in short, paid every attention we could have expected,, had we dined at a guinea ordinary. I will take an opportunity of describing their method of cooking hereafter; this I can tell thee, that the hog was done to a turn , as. cooks phrase it: the taro much better baked than we could possibly do it on board; and the whole repast, (if we except the method of making gravy) was managed with a degree of decency and cleanliness, little to be expected in a place so very remote from civilized' refinements, and' where nature and necessity alone have furnished, the utensils for preparations of this fort.

A couple of nails engaged my new waterman, and he took me with pleasure for a passenger.

After we had proceeded about half a mile up the river, my man jumped hastily out of the canoe, without giving me the least notice,, by which means it was near being upset. I was not alarmed at this circumstance, as the water was not out of my depth; but I was rather surprised to hear Berre , Berre, called aloud, by a voice which I had some knowledge of: on looking round, I saw one of the natives making hastily towards us, through the water, and the fame moment recognized the man I engaged to attend me in the morning.

Having dismissed the canoe, I went towards a straggling village, at a small distance from the river; here I met several of our people, who had walked up the valley amongst the plantations. Some of them had been a considerable distance farther up, but none so far as the river head ; they confirmed me, however, in my conjecture, that it was not navigable for canoes more than half a mile higher up. We learnt that this village was the place of Abbenoue's residence, and were (hewn several houses which belonged to him ; but that he had not been on shore since the morning, having been all the day with Popote, or Captain Portlock. There are a number of houses scattered here and there all the way, from this village to the beach; and as we walked leisurely along, the inhabitants were continually pressing us to stop a while, and repose ourselves under the trees, which generally grow about their habitations.

They are laid out in a variety of forms, according to the fancy of the different owners, whose various shares are marked with the most scrupulous exactness : these are intersected at convenient distances by raised foot-paths, about two feet wide. I should observe, that these plantations range entirely along the river-tide, and the houses I have been speaking of are situated to the Westward of the extreme path.

Our motive for coming to this place was to search for our anchor, and the whale-boat was immediately hoisted out for that purpose ; but all our endeavours were ineffectual, though we had taken exact bearings of the place where it was lost, and the water was tolerably smooth: the buoys we had left were either drifted away, or stolen by the natives.

We had reason to suppose, from every information we were able to procure, that the King grew tired of us, and had tabooed the people, in order to prevent any refreshments being brought on board the vessels, thinking from our frequent visits, that we intended to settle at Atoui: indeed appearances might warrant a supposition of this kind.

I LEFT thee at the conclusion of my last, immediately on our coming to anchor, and I doubt not by this time, thou art impatient to be acquainted with our proceedings. As I know nothing more disagreeable than a state of fuspence, I will immediately endeavour to relieve thee from it, in the best manner I can. It seems, Captain Portlock's motive for coming to anchor, as already mentioned, was a sight of two canoes, at some distance up the bay, which gave him reason to expect meeting with inhabitants, and consequently that some business might be done; a thing we were most particularly anxious about, as this, our last season, was already flipping away. In the evening of the 24th, five canoes came along-side us, but brought no furs, or traffic of any kind. They saluted us by extending their arms, and a frequent repetition of the word Lauleigh , generally laying a great emphasis on the latter syllable. This we understood as a friendly salutation, and returned it by similar gesticulations, and a repetition of the word Lauleigh. On our enquiry for Notoonejhuck , which is the name they use for sea otter's skin, they immediately pointed towards Prince William's Sound, repeating the words \" Nootka Notoonejhuck ,\" plenty, very frequently, and in the most earnest manner.

We were pretty much puzzled to account for these circumstances, though it appeared very evident, from these people speaking English, and having some idea of our manners, that an English vessel either lay in the sound at the present moment, or had been there very recently ; but none of us could guess at the meaning of Nootka, though they repeated that word much oftener than any of the rest. These canoes were covered with skins, the same as we had seen last season in Cook's River: three of them were built for two men each, and the two others held only a single person. The ears of these Indians were ornamented with plenty of small blue beads, but these, we had reason to suppose, were procured from the Ruffians, as some knives and iron weapons which they shewed us, were evidently of Ruffian manufacture. Early in the morning of the 25th, our boats were sent on shore for wood and water, both which were very easily procured. In the mean time, our Captains went all round the bay, and examined every adjacent creek and inlet, but found ho inhabitants, nor any traces of recent habitations in this part, which made us conclude, that our visitors were only a hunting party from Prince William's Sound; however, we made them some trifling presents, hoping, that it might induce them not only to bring us furs, but also encourage their neighbours to follow their example: they seemed perfectly satisfied with the trifles we gave them, and told us, that they would return soon and bring Notoonejhuck, plenty.

Bad weather coming on, at eight o'clock I put into a cove fin Montague Island; but towards nine o'clock, the weather clearing up, I proceeded round the North East end of the island into a large bay : here I found some Indians on a hunting party, who gave me to understand, that they belonged to Cape Hinchinbrooke. It being late in the afternoon, I came to an anchor for the night in the long boat, and made the whale-boats fast, one on each fide. \" As the Indians did not leave us when night came on, I ordered six hands to keep watch, and the remainder to have their arms ready, so that I might call them at a moment's notice. The Indians fculked about us till near two o'clock, waiting, no doubt, for an opportunity to cut the boats off, but finding us attentive to all their motions, they then left us. \" At four o'clock m the morning of the 6th, I weighed, and stood over for Cape Hinchinbrooke, where I came to anchor at half past ten.

The Indians whom I had traded with for furs, during the afternoon, were a different tribe from that I met with in the bay at the North East end of Montague Island: their behaviour was very daring and insolent, though they did not directly attack us, and they did not leave the boats till day-light the next morning. I make no doubt but that a sight of the various articles I had brought to trade with these people, occasioned them to lurk about us the whole night, in hopes of obtaining a booty, but finding themselves disappointed, they paddled away, seemingly much discontented. \" Early in the morning of the 7th, I set off for Snug Corner Cove; but the wind during the whole day being very light, the long boat made little way, so that the whale boats were obliged to take her in tow : this retarded my passage la much, that I did not arrive in the cove till eleven o'clock in the evening, Contrary to my expectation, I found no vessel in the cove, neither did I perceive any of the inhabitants; notwithstanding which, I ordered the fame strict watch to be kept as before, well remembering, that the' Discovery was boarded by the.. natives in this very cove, during Captain Cook's last Voyage, in open day. \" During the night, none of the inhabitants came near us; but at day-light in the morning of the 8th, two Indians came along- U side 1787.

In this straight he met with a party of Ruffian settlers, who informed him, that the land to the Eastward of the straight is called by them Codiac , and that they had a settlement there ; likewise that two European vessels were then at anchor at Codiac, and that they had lately seen two other ships in Cook's River. This intelligence induced him to steer for Prince William's Sound, where he arrived the latter end of September. \" He had wintered in the creek where I now found him, and his vessel was still fast in the ice. The scurvy had made sad havock amongst his people, he having lost his Second and Third Mates, the Surgeon, Boatswain, Carpenter, Cooper, Sail-maker, and a great number of the foremast men, by that dreadful disorder; and the remaining part of his crew were so enfeebled at one time, that Captain Meares himself was the only person on board able to walk the deck. \" It gave him very great pleasure to find two vessels so near, who could assist him in some measure in his distress ; and I had no less satisfaction in assuring him, that he should be furnished with every necessary we could possibly spare. As Captain Meares's people were now getting better, he defired me not to take the trouble of sending any refreshments to him, as he would come on board us very shortly in his own boat. \" I left the Nootka at three o'clock in the morning of the 9th, and got to my boats about eight: at ten o'clock I weighed, and stood down for our ships, being now convinced, that there was no prospect:"}, {"page_label": "Seite 196", "page_text": "A VOYAGE TO THE prospect of my meeting with any furs of consequence.

Happening to cast his eyes on a frying-pan, which my people in the long boat had to dress their victuals with, he requested to have it in barter; accordingly, it was offered him, but he absolutely refused to take it entire, and desired us to break off the handle, which he seemed to regard as a thing of inestimable value, and rejected the bottom part with contempt. \" Towards six o'clock, the wind freshening, the whale boats were cast off, and soon afterwards the weather grew very rough, with constant snow and fleet, which occasioned the boats to separate.

They told us various stories respecting their success in trade, but on these much reliance was not to be placed, as the Captain and Mate seldom agreed in their accounts : at one time, they had purchased two thousand fea-otter skins; at another, not more than seven hundred. This, however, is pretty certain, that they had- procured a considerable quantity of valuable furs, and these chiefly, , if not altogether, in Prince William's Sound. It was Captain Meares's intention to have compleated his Voyage in twelve months; but the frost setting in sooner than they expected, had unavoidably detained them in the sound during the winter. The great loss they sustained by sickness has already been related; unfortunately when the remaining part of Captain Meares's crew were weak and enfeebled to the last degree, they were greatly distressed for fuel; and for some time it was with the- greatest difficulty that they got wood on board for their daily use.. On our enquiring whether the scurvy, unattended with any other- complaint, had made such fatal havock amongst the people belonging to the Nootka, we were informed, that a free and unrestrained use of spirits had been indiscriminately allowed them during the extreme cold weather, which they had drank to such excess about Christmas, that numbers of them kept their hammocks for a fort- . night together ; add to this, their liquor was of a very pernicious kind, so that there is reason to suppose its effects, when drank to - such an extreme, were not less fatal than the scurvy itself. Admitting this to be the cafe, it surely was ill-judged in Captain Meares to suffer such hurtful excesses amongst his people; and I am afraid that a scanty supply of the various antiscorbutics absolutely necessary for these voyages, put it out of their power to check. this cruel disorder, so often fatal to sea-faring people.

O U R last season on the coast being now advancing very fast, a separation was agreed on as the most likely means of promoting our success for the remaining part of the year; accordingly, it was determined to send Captain Portlock's long boat, under the direction of Messrs. Hay ward and Hill, to trade in Cook's River. The King George was to stay in Prince William's Sound, till the boat's return, and our vessel was to fail for King George's Sound, at the same time, keeping well in with the coast, that no opportunity of collecting Furs might be lost: this distribution of ourselves, thou wilt perhaps fay, was judicious ; and indeed it was high time for us to strain every nerve ; for what with finding ourselves anticipated at this place, and the great probability of being served the same at King George's Sound, our best prospects were far from pleasing. In the afternoon of the 12th of May, Messrs. Hay ward and Hill set out in the long boat for Cook's River, taking with them a proper assortment of articles necessary for trading with the natives.

About one o'clock, we had the pleasure of seeing two large -canoes, and several small ones, full of Indians, come round the North East point of the bay. When they came in sight of the vessels, they began to sing, keeping regular time with the strokes of their paddles in the water : their singing seemed to be in a great measure directed by the Chief, and the cadence was not without some degree of harmony. When they came along-side the King George, they were profuse t In their friendly salutations; at the same time their Chief, whose name was Shanway, strewed a letter for Captain Portlock, which came, he said, from the Nootka , on which he was admitted on board, together with a number of his people. It seems the hunting party we saw at our first coming in, on the 24th of April, belonged to old Shan way's tribe; these people lived near Snug Corner Cove, and on their return had acquainted Captain Meares, that they had seen two strips at anchor a great distance down the channel; on which he immediately wrote the above-mentioned letter, without knowing whom particularly to address it to, and gave it to the Indians, who promised to return back to us immediately ; but these trusty messengers never found their way till now, when the letter was of no consequence.

I could fee most of their transactions from our quarter-deck, and must fay, they were managed with a good deal of art. Shanway, and some of his attendants endeavoured to a^nuse the King George's people with singing and dancing, whilst others traversed the decks, and threw every thing which came in their way to their companions in the canoes. Captain Portlock was _ presently aware of his guests thievish disposition ; but being unwilling to drive them away by force, he stationed his people in different parts of the vessel to watch their motions : notwithstanding this precaution, they stole a number of articles, and got them unperceived into their canoes. Whenever they were detected in a theft, they relinquished their booty with the utmost unconcern ; but when any thing was once in their 1 poffeffion, it was with difficulty they were prevailed on to restore it. At first, the only articles they attempted to steal, were iron and cloaths; but finding themselves watched, they became indiscriminate plunderers, and seized on every thing in their power. 1787.

Our whale-boat, at this time, lay at anchor about two miles distant from the vessels, the people in her busy fishing, which the Indians happening to fee, as they paddled out of the bay, they directly made up to them.

When our people came on board, we found our fears for their safety were not groundless. The Indians had attempted to steal their anchor, and had actually taken several of their fishing-lines; nay, one of them attempted to run his spear through a young fellow, because he refused to give up his line, but was prevented by Shan way, who, fortunately for the people, was, it seems, of a pacific disposition, and contented himself with plundering in quiet. These were sufficient cautions to us in future, not to trust any Indians, even to come on board : indeed Captain Meares had informed us, that a ship from China had a quarrel with the inhabitants of King George's Sound, in which several of the Indians lost their lives; and that the natives afterwards traded with as much unconcern as if nothing had happened. Our fishing party had tolerable success; they caught a large quantity of sand-dabs, and a few rock-fisli. The birds and marine productions here are much the same as in the first bay we anchored in ; and it is probable there may be salmon farther on in the season, when the heat of the sun, by melting the snow, causes fresh water rivulets; but at this time, it had scarcely made any impression on that dreary element; and the surrounding prospect teemed with all the horrors of winter.

East; our distance from the shore less than a mile. During, the time we were warping into the bay, several canoes came alongside us. We accosted the people with some of the words in use amongst the natives of Prince William's Sound, but they had not the least idea of their meaning: indeed it was pretty evident at first sight, that these people were a different nation, from the construction of their canoes, which were altogether of wood, neatly finished, and in shape not very much unlike our whale-boats. To the Southward of our present situation was a narrow creek, which appeared to lead a great distance into the country, and widened as it advanced in shore. Early in the morning of the 24th, we saw a number of the natives on the beach, near the entrance of this creek, making signals for us to come on shore : a smoke was also seen, which proceeded from behind some pines, at a small distance round the point. On this Captain Dixon went in the whale-boat to survey the place, thinking it probable, from these circumstances, that the Indians chiefly resided here; and should there be convenient anchorage, the situation would be a more eligible one than that found out by Mr. Turner.

At two o'clock we came to anchor in eight fathom water, over a bottom of soft mud, within pistol shot of the , shore, and very near two large Indian huts. We were now eompleatly land-locked, being entirely surrounded by low flat islands, where scarcely any snow could be seen, and well sheltered from any wind or weather whatever. The people seemed very well pleased at our arrival, and a number • of them presently camealong-side us. They soon understood what we wanted, and an old man brought us eight or ten excellent sea otter skins. This circumstance, together with our having as yet seen no beads, or other ornaments, or any iron implements, gave us reason to conclude, that no trading party had ever been here, and consequently that we should reap a plentiful harvest; but our conjectures on this head were built on a sandy foundation; for on a further acquaintance with our neighbours, they shewed us plenty of beads, and the fame kind of knives and spears we had seen in Prince William's Sound; and as a melancholy proof that we only glean- > ' \"d after more fortunate traders, what furs they brought to fell, exclusive of the small quantity just mentioned, were of a very inferior kind.

However, the morning of the ist of June proving tolerably clear, he went in the whale-boat at ten o'clock, in order to examine the adjacent harbours, taking with him one of the Indians who had frequently been on board, and who was a tolerably intelligent fellow, as a guide. At five in the afternoon, Captain Dixon returned from his survey, which had by no means answered his expectations. He had found several huts scattered here and there, in various parts of the found, but they were mostly inhabited by people whom we had already seen; and there was not a single skin of any value amongst them : indeed our success at this place fell greatly short of what we had reason to expect, from its promising situation, and the first appearance of inhabitants; but this poverty was not to be discovered on a sudden, for though the whole that we purchased here consisted only of about sixteen good sea otter fldns, two fine cloaks of the earless marmot, a few racoons, and a parcel of very inferior pieces and flips of beaver, sufficient to fill one Jingle puncheon; yet it was not till the 3d of June, (ten days from the time of our coming into the harbour) that we found the natives scanty stock of furs not only exhausted, but that they had stripped themselves almost naked, to spin out their trade as far as possible.

Should this manœuvre not succeed, after much deliberation, their cargo is produced, and generally consists of a few trifling pieces of old sea otter skins, and even then, a considerable time is taken up before the bargain is concluded; so that a whole day would frequently be spent in picking up a few trifles. Such, however, was our present situation, in regard to trade, that we patiently submitted to the tantalizing method of these people, in hopes that something better might possibly be brought us; but finding they were stripped almost naked, and not the most distant probability of any better success, Captain Dixon determined to leave this place the first opportunity.

How extensive the found is, I cannot fay ; it contains a number of small low islands, but at intervals, when the fog cleared up, we could discern high mountainous land, to the Northward and Westward, at about ten leagues distant, entirely covered with snow, and which we judged to be part of the continent.

'Tis probable, that the chief reason why these Indians take no greater pains in the structure of their habitations is, that their situation is merely temporary: no sooner does the master of a tribe find game begin to grow scarce, or sisti not so plentiful as he expected, than he takes down his hut, puts the boards into his canoe, and paddles away to seek out for a spot better adapted to his various purposes, which, having found, he presently erects his dwelling in the lame carelelefs manner as before.

'Our whale-boat was one day sent with seven hands to this place, on a fishing party ; but their success was greatly inferior to that of two Indians, who were fiihing at the fame time, which is rather extraordinary, if we consider the apparent inferiority of their tackle to our's. Their hook is a large simple piece of wood, the shank at least half an inch in diameter; that part which turns up, and which forms an acute angle, is considerably smaller, and brought gradually to a point: a flat piece of wood, about six inches long, and near two inches wide, is neatly lashed to the shank, on the back of which is rudely carved the representation of an human face. I cannot think that this was altogether designed as an ornament to their hooks, but that it has some religious allusion, and possibly is intended as a kind of Deity, to ensure their success in fiihing, which is conducted in a singular manner. They bait their hook with a kind of fish, called by the .sailors squids , and having funk it to the bottom, they fix a bladder to the end of the line as a buoy, and should that not watch sufficiently, they add another. Their lines are very strong, being made of the sinews or intestines of animals. One man is sufficient to look after five or six of these buoys; when he perceives a fish bite, he is in no great hurry to haul up his line, but gives him time to be well hooked; and when he has hauled the fdh up to the surface of the water, he knocks him on the head with a Ihort club, provided for that purpose, and afterwards stows his prize away at his leisure: this is done to prevent the halibut (which sometimes are very large) from damaging, or perhaps upsetting his canoe in their dying struggles.

They dress their victuals by putting heated stones into a kind of wicker basket, amongst pieces offish, seal, porpoise, &c. and covered up close; sometimes they make broth and fisti soup by the same method, which they always preferred to boiling, though we gave them some brass pans, and pointed out the mode of using, them. The Indians are particularly fond of chewing a plant, which appears to be a species of tobacco j not content, however, with chewing it in its simple state, they generally mix lime along with it,, and sometimes the inner rind of the pine-tree, together with a rosinous substance extracted from it. When we came into this harbour, on the 23d of May, our attention was a good deal engaged by the sight of a number of white rails, on a level piece of ground, not far from the creek which I have already observed was situated to the Southward of us. These rails were about a mile and half from the vessel, and appeared, at that distance, to be constructed with such order and regularity, that we concluded them beyond the reach of Indian contrivance,. and consequently that they were erected by some civilized nation. Captain Dixon, willing to be satisfied in this particular, took an opportunity of going to the spot, and to his great surprize, found it to be a kind of burying-place, if I may be allowed to call that so, where dead bodies are not deposited in the earth. The manner in which they dispose of their dead is very remarkable: they separate the head from the body, and wrapping them in furs, the-"}, {"page_label": "Seite 218", "page_text": "176 A VOYAGE TO THE 1787.

At each end of the chest which contains the body, a thick pole, about ten feet long, is drove into the earth in a slanting position, so that the upper ends meet together, and are very firmly lashed with a kind of rope prepared for the purpose. About two feet from the top of this arch, a small piece of timber goes across, and is very neatly fitted to each pole : on this piece of timber the box which contains the head is fixed, and very strongly secured with rope; the box is frequently decorated with two or three rows of small stiells, and sometimes teeth, which are let into the wood with great neatness and ingenuity; and as an additional ornament, is painted with a variety of colours j but the poles are uniformly painted white. Sometimes these poles are fixed upright in the earth, and on each side the body, but the head is always secured in the position already described. What ceremony is used by these people, in depositing their dead in this manner, we never could learn, as nothing of the kind happened during our stay in the harbour. Besides the skins I have mentioned already, we purchased a few bears, and some land beaver; but I rather think, that the marmot cloaks were procured by these people from some neighbouring tribe. Toes were the article of trade held in the first estimation here, and next to these, pewter basons were best liked.

At fix o'clock the cape bore North North West, and our distance from shore about a mile. We now opened a very large and extensive bay, which had every appearance of an excellent harbour. About a mile to the Southward of the cape is a small island, and we steered right for the passage betwixt that and the cape; but at seven o'clock, seeing a quantity of rock-weed right a-head, Captain Dixon judged it prudent to haul off shore to the Southward, during the night. At one o'clock in the morning of the 12th, we tacked, and stood - in for the bay, leaving the small island just mentioned to the Westward, with a light breeze from North West by West.

About six o'clock we saw a large boat full of people, at a very considerable distance out at sea, making towards us as fast as possible; she hoisted something which had the appearance of a white flag, but we could not distinguish, with the help of our glasses, what nation she belonged to; and various were our conjectures on this head. Some of us judged them to be Russians; and others thought they possibly might be Spaniards, who had been left here ever since the year 1775, at which time two Spanish vessels were at anchor near this place; or that they belonged to some strip, which probably lay here at present: however, as they came nearer, we perceived it to be an Indian canoe, and on their coming up with us, we had the pleasure to find, that they belonged to the sound we were steering for.

Soon after six o'clock, the breeze dying away, our whale-boat came on board, the yawl was hoisted out, and both boats sent a-head, in order to tow the vessel into the bay. During this time, we bought a few furs of trifling value, from our new acquaintance ; and they gave us to understand, that we should find a number of inhabitants, and plenty of furs, in the adjacent harbour. This piece of intelligence, though not absolutely to be depended on, elated us not a little. What we had taken for a white flag, on our first seeing the canoe, was a tuft of white feathers which they had hoisted at the top of a long pole, and which I understand to be an emblem of peace and. friendship. At ten o'clock we saw a bay to the Northward, which appeared to be well sheltered from the wind ; and a breeze springing up, we stood right in for it. Mr. Turner was sent in the whale-boat up the found, to look for a harbour ; and Mr. White, our Third Mate, was sent in the yawl, into the bay a-head, in order to examine the soundings. Soon after eleven o'clock Mr. White returned, and reported, that the bay appeared to be an excellent place for the vessel to lay in, there being good anchorage from eight to twelve fathom water, over a sandy bottom. After making a few short boards, we came to anchor at twelve o'clock, in eight fathom water, over a sandy bottom; the extremes of the land forming the bay to the Northward, bore from South 3 deg. West to North 3 deg. East; the point of land to the South East, South East by South ; about three quarters of a mile distant from stiore.

About four in the afternoon, Mr. Turner returned from his survey in the whale-boat: he had found several harbours well sheltered from any wind, but the bottom in general rocky; so that Captain Dixon determined to keep his present situation, as it appeared well sheltered from bad weather, and convenient for the inhabitants to visit us. Whilst Mr. Turner was out in the whale-boat, he saw a large cave, formed by nature in the side of a mountain, about four miles, to the Northward of our anchoring birth : curiosity prompted him to go on shore, in order to examine it, as there appeared something which, at a distance, looked bright and sparkling. On getting' into the cave, he found the object which attracted his attention to- be a square box, with a human head in it, deposited in the manner already described at Port Mulgrave ; the box was very beautifully ornamented with small (hells, and seemed to have been left there very recently, being the only one in the place. This circumstance seems to shew, that the natives of this place dispose of their dead in the same manner as at Port Mulgrave, but probably make choice of caves for that purpose, in preference to the open air.. At day-light in the morning of the 13th, we had a number of canoes full of inhabitants along-side; after a considerable time spent in singing, a pretty brisk trade commenced, and we bought a number of excellent otter (kins ; the people seemed far more lively and alert than those we had left at Fort Mulgrave ; and from s every appearance, we had reason to expect an excellent trade at this place. From this to the 16th, our trade went briskly forward, but afterwards it began to decline, and several of the Indians left us, in order to bring a further supply of (kins from their neighbours.

A VOYAGE TO THE Toes are the article of traffic held in the first estimation at this place; but they always refused small ones, wanting them in general from eight to fourteen inches long. Besides these, we traded with pewter basons, hatchets, howels, buckles, rings, &c. Of these the basons were best liked; for though the hatchets and howels were obviously the most useful tools these people could possibly have, yet they were only taken in exchange for furs of inferior value. Beads of every fort were constantly refused with contempt, when offered by way of barter, and would scarcely be accepted as presents. In the evening of the 16th, a fresh gale of wind came on from the Southward, which caused a very heavy sea to set into the bay. We were preparing to strike the top-masts, when fortunately, about midnight, the weather moderated. This circumstance, however, served to strew us, that the bay was not so securely slreltered from bad weather as we at first imagined. From the 17th to the 21st, our trade gradually fell off; and towards the last, they brought us scarcely any thing but rubbish, being pieces of old cloaths nearly wore out; however, we had no reason to complain of their backwardness in parting with what little trade they had left; their conduct in this particular being quite the reverse to that of our old friends in Port Mulgrave. Amongst the people who came to trade with us, was an old man, who seemed remarkably intelligent: he gave us to understand, that a good while ago there had been two vessels at anchor near this place, one of which was considerably larger than our's; that they carried a great number of guns, and that the people resembled us in colour and dress.

In the Journal of the Spanish Voyage, published by the Honourable Daines Harrington, the Spaniards are said to have anchored in 57 deg. 18 min. North latitude: we now lay in 57 deg. 3 min. North latitude; and the old man, when describing the situation of the above ships, always pointed up the found, to the Northward, which helped to confirm us in our opinion, that the people described by him must have been the Spaniards. Should this conjecture be right, it sufficiently proves,, that this place is seldom visited by* Europeans ; for in that cafe, a variety of ships would have rendered the accounts of our new acquaintance confused and imperfect on the contrary, his remarks were always clear and pertinent, and uniformly tended to describe the same object. During this time, though trade principally engaged our attention, yet a number of subordinate, though necessary employments, were carried on; parties were frequently sent on shore, some to cut fire-wood, others to fill up our water, and the carpenters cut a spare top-mast, and several spars, for various purposes. The water was procured from a small river round a point of land, at the distance of a mile from the ship. \" At first, the natives behaved civilly enough, and suffered our people to follow their various employments unmolested; but they soon grew very troublesome, and attempted to pick their pockets, and even. to steal their saws and axes in the most open, daring ■ • manner j"}, {"page_label": "Seite 226", "page_text": "184 A VOYAGE TO THE I 1787, manner ; indeed they could scarcely be restrained from these pro- _^ Une ' _■ ceedings without violence ; but this it was neither our interest or inclination to offer, if it could possibly be avoided. Our people were never sent on shore without being well armed ; and luckily, the sight of a few musquets kept them in a kind of awe, as they had frequently seen Captain Dixon shoot birds, which had given them an idea of the fatal effects of fire-arms; so that our business on shore was compleated without coming to an open quarrel with these people In my next I may, perhaps, give thee some further account of this place, which Captain Dixon distinguished by the name of Norfolk Sound, in honour of his Grace the Duke of Norfolk, and I sincerely wish, that what little I have already said, respecting our success, may give thee half the pleasure it has given to thine assuredly, W.

Had the wind permitted us, to have looked round the South East point of the cape, agreeable to our intention in the morning of the 15th of September last, we without doubt should have found our present harbour. During the greatest part of the time we lay here, the weather was pretty moderate, the mean of the thermometer 48 deg. the wind generally light, and varying from South East to South West. 185 -787, June. The shore here, in common with the rest of the coast, abounds with pines; there is also greater quantities of the witch hazle here, than we had hitherto met with. We found various kinds of flowering trees and shrubs, amongst which were wild gooseberries, currants, and rasberries ; wild parsley is found here in great plenty; we picked great quantities of it, and it eats excellently, either as a fallad, or boiled amongst soup. The faranne, or wild lilly-root, grows here in great plenty and perfection. There are very few wild geese or ducks seen here, and those shy and difficult of approach. Captain Dixon, as I before observed, was frequently on shore with his fowling-piece ; but he shot any thing that came in his way indiscriminately, his chief motive being rather to shew the Indians the effects of fire-arms, than to pursue game ; and the event shewed that his intention was compleatly answered. The inhabitants frequently caught halibut, and we saw large quantities of salmon frequently hung up on shore to dry, but they were not very willing to sell it, which shews, that fish is a principal and favourite article of food here: we indeed purchased a few A a salmon,."}, {"page_label": "Seite 230", "page_text": "A VOYAGE TO THE 186 1787- salmon, but they were of a very inferior kind to those we met with ,_f in Cook's River.

Whether the method of fishing here is the same with that at Port Mulgrave, I cannot fay, as we never had an opportunity of feeing them at that employment. There are great quantities of muscles in some parts of the found, together with a few crabs, star-fish, &c. I endeavoured to make a calculation of the number of inhabit tants who reside in the found, and its environs; the greatest; number I ever saw about the ship at one time, was 175, including women and children. Were I to estimate these at half the number who live here, it would perhaps not be far from the truth; but supposing an allowance to be made for the aged and infirm, and for those who were absent, engaged in hunting, fishing, &c. I think 450 people will be the whole of the natives found here, taking the computation in its utmost: extent, and including men, women, and children. These people in their make, shape, and features, are pretty much the fame with those we saw in Port Mulgrave; their faces are also painted with a variety of colours; the women, too, ornament, or rather distort rheir lips in the fame manner as I have already described ; and it should seem, that the female who is ornamented with the largest; piece of wood, is generally most respected by her friends, and by the community in general.

When the girls arrive to the age of fourteen or fifteen, the center of the under lip, in the thick part near the mouth, is simply perforated, and a piece of copper wire introduced to prevent the aperture from closing; the aperture afterwards is lengthened, from time to time, in a line parallel with the mouth, and the wooden ornaments are enlarged in proportion, till they are frequently increased to three, or even four inches in length, and nearly as wide, but this generally happens, when the matron is advanced in years, and consequently the muscles are relaxed; so that possibly old age may obtain greater respect: than this very singular ornament.. The manners and disposition of the people here, approach nearer to those in Cook's River, and Prince William's Sound, than our friends in Port Mulgrave; but this may, perhaps, in some measure, be accounted for from their enlarged society, and their constant intercourse with each other. Their traffic, and indeed all their concerns, so far as fell under my observation, appear to be conducted with great order and regularity ; they constantly came along-side to trade with us at daylight in the morning, and never failed to spend more than half an hour in singing before the traffic commenced. The Chief of the tribe has always the entire management of all the trade belonging to his people, and takes infinite pains to dispose of their furs advantageously.

About twelve o'clock they constantly left the ship, and went on .shore, where they staid about an hour, which time, as we had frequent opportunities of observing, was taken up in eating. This . evidently shews, that they have at least one fixed m,eal in the day, and that it is regulated by the fun. They likewise frequently left us about four in the afternoon; but this time was not so exactly observed as at noon. Towards the evening we in general ^ad far the greatest number of visitants ; but by this time the trade of the day was pretty well over, and numbers came only by way of relaxation, after the fatigue of their various employments, though sometimes we had excellent Ikins brought us in the evening, by traders who had been out during the day amongst their neighbours in the adjacent harbours* It was one fine evening, when we were surrounded both by traders and people brought by curiosity, that I counted 175 people, as I have before observed; and I am pretty confident, that the conclusion I drew from that estimate, will be the extreme number of inhabitants living in this found.

One peculiar custom I took notice of here, which as yet we had I7 g 7 . been strangers to. The moment a Chief has concluded a bargain, he J une - repeats the word Coocoo thrice, with quickness, and is immediately answered by all the people in his canoe with the word Whoah , pronounced in a tone of exclamation, but with greater or less energy, in proportion as the bargain he has made is approved of. The cloaths wore universally on the coast are made of skins sewed together in various forms, and which I will endeavour to describe more particularly by and bye; I just mention them now from a remarkable circumstance. One of the Chiefs who came to trade with us, happening one day to cast his eyes on a piece of Sandwich Island cloth, which hung up in the shrouds to dry, became very importunate to have it given him. The man to whom the cloth belonged, parted with it very willingly, and the Indian was perfectly overjoyed with his present. After selling what furs he had brought with great dispatch, he immediately left us, and paddled on shore, without favouring us with a parting song, as is generally the custom. Soon after day-light the next morning, our friend appeared along-side, dressed in a coat made of the Sandwich Island cloth given him the day before, and cut exactly in the form of their Ikin-coats, which greatly resemble a waggoner's frock, except the collar and wrist-bands. The Indian was more proud of his new acquired dress than ever London beau was of a birth-day suit, and we were greatly pleased with this proof of these people's ingenuity and dispatch; the coat fitted exceedingly well; the seams were sewed with all the strength the cloth would admit of, and with a degree of neatness equal to that of an English mantua-maker.

These notions of the Chief immediately brought to my recollection those beautiful lines of Pope, in his Essay on Man. \" Lo! the poor Indian whose untutor'd mind, \" Sees God in clouds, or hears him in the wind, \" His foul, proud science never taught to stray, \" Far as the solar walk or milky way, \" Yet simple nature to his hope has giv'n , .1 \" Behind the cloud-topt hill an humble Heav'n; ' \" Some safer world in depth of woods embrae'd, \\ \" Some happier island in the watry waste, \" Where slaves once more their native land behold, \" No fiends torment, no Christians thirst for gold. \" To be, contents his natural desire, \" He asks no angel's wing, no seraph's fire, \" But thinks admitted to that equal sky, \" His faithful dog shall bear him company.\" The Indians here alluded to by Pope, are undoubtedly those of South America; yet many of these lines are applicable to the people on this side of the continent. The man I have just been speaking of had, no doubt, some idea of a Supreme Being ; and if we admit the probability of their morning and evening songs being intended as a kind of adoration to that Supreme Being, it will serve to give us no very inadequate idea of their religion.

I had no opportunity of examining them minutely, but they appear to be made of reeds sewed very closely together, and I was told by one of our gentlemen who was with Captain Cook during his last Voyage, that they are exactly the fame with those wore by the inhabitants of New Zealand. In regard to the language here, I have some reason to think it is nearly the fame with that at Port Mulgrave ; however, as it may perhaps be in my power to obtain some further information respecting this article before we leave the coast, I will resume the subject at a future opportunity. I have already mentioned, that our trade seemed nearly over by the 21st June, and we perceived on the 22d the natives were stripped of every thing worth carrying away, so that it was determined to leave this place the first fair wind. Our success at this place, if it did not answer our most sanguine expectations, was nevertheless by far the most encouraging we had hitherto met with. We purchased about two hundred excellent sea otter skins, a good quantity of inferior pieces of sea otter, together with a large parcel of indifferent pieces and flips; about one hundred good seals, and a great number of fine beaver tails.

In the ,j^ u ' ie ' afternoon the breeze freshened, and at six o'clock we saw a fine entrance, bearing East North East, on which we shortened sail, and stood in for it. On our approaching nearer in with the land, the channel a-head had the appearance of a river from the North ; but the tide setting strongly out of it, and the wind shifting to the Northward, we stood into a fine harbour, which now opened to the South East. At the entrance we had soundings from fifty to sixty fathom water, over a rocky bottom ; but as we advanced farther in, the soundings lessened to twenty-one fathom, with mud, on which we came to an anchor, being compleatly land-locked, and within musquet shot of the shore, both to the Southward and Northward.

The creek run a considerable distance in land, and terminated at the foot of a mountain, from whence it received a copious supply of fresh water, occasioned by the heat of the sun melting the snow on the tops of the mountains, and which now had such power as to supply a constant rivulet.

Near this place were the vestiges of an Indian hut, which seemed to have been recently taken away, and probably had been the temporary habitation of some hunting party. Various kinds of flowers and flowering shrubs, were springing up in the valley near the rivulet, and though no inhabitants were found here, yet the place seems peculiarly eligible for a summer residence, and more so, as there is a probability of meeting with plenty of fine salmon ; so that I have little doubt of its being constantly frequented by the natives, farther on in the season. After dinner, Captain Dixon went to examine the passage to the Northward. The afternoon being very sine, our furs were got upon deck, and spread out to air ; they had not received the least damage by being packed in puncheons; some of the inferior ones were grown mouldy, but that, when dry, was easily rubbed off. Captain Dixon not returning when the evening came on, we began to- feel a good deal of anxiety for his safety, though he had seven people in the boat well armed; however, about eleven o'clock we were relieved from our fears by the boat's return; they had not met with the least vestige of any inhabitants, though they had been at least six leagues distant from the vessel.. Several of our powder-barrels being unhooped, and the powder grown wet and damp, this harbour was judged a most eligible spot to dry the powder, and get the barrels repaired, especially as the weather was remarkably clear and serene ; so at eight in the morning of the 25th, the gunner took the powder on shore, and the cooper was sent to repair the calks, In the mean time, Captain Dixon went in the boat to examine about the entrance into this harbour, as we had taken notice, in the afternoon of the 23d, of some inlets to the Southward and Westward.

The powder was got into very good order, and ,787. brought on board early in the afternoon. The carpenters were on ,_^ une ' , shore, and cut atop-mast, and some spars for various uses. About seven o'clock Captain Dixon returned, having met with no better success than before; he had been in several bays at a considerable distance from the harbour, but could not perceive the least traces of people or habitations. \\ / This harbour is situated in 36deg. 35 min. North latitude; and 135 deg. West longitude : it obtained the name of Port Banks, in honour of Sir Joseph Banks. The prospect at Port Banks, though rather confined, yet has something in it more pleasing and romantic than any we had seen on the coast. The land to the Northward and Southward rises to an elevation sufficient to convey every idea of winter ; and though its sides are perpetually covered with snow, yet the numerous pines which ever and anon pop out their bushy heads, entirely divest it of that dreary and horrific cast with the barren mountains to the North West of Cook's River. To the Eastward, the land is considerably lower, and the pines appear to grow in the most regular and exact order : these, together with the brush-wood and shrubs on the surrounding beaches, form a most beautiful contrast to the higher land, and render the appearance of the whole truly pleasing and delightful. As our staying here any longer was only a needless waste of time, at half past three o'clock in the morning of the 26th, we weighed anchor, and, it being calm, sent the boats a-head to tow the vessel out of the bay.

This we looked on as a good omen, and the event shewed, that for once we were not mistaken. After their curiosity, in some measure, subsided, they began to trade, and we presently bought what cloaks and skins they had got, in exchange for toes, which they seemed to like very much. They made signs for us to go in towards the shore, and gave us to understand, that we should find more inhabitants, and plenty of furs. By ten o'clock we Were within a mile of the shore, and saw the village where these Indians dwelt right a-breast of us: it consisted of about six huts, which appeared to be built in a more regular form than any we had yet seen, and the situation very pleasant, but the shore was rocky, and afforded no place for us to anchor in. A bay now opened to the Eastward, on which we hauled by the wind, which blew pretty fresh from the Northward and Eastward, and steered directly for it. During this time, several of the people whom we traded with in the morning, had been on shore, probably to strew their newly acquired bargains ; but on seeing us steer for the bay, they presently pushed after us, joined by several other canoes. As we advanced Up the bay, there appeared to be an excellent harbour, well land-locked, about a league a-head; we had foundings from ten to twenty-five fathom water, over a rocky bottom, but unluckily, the harbour trended right in the wind, and at one o'clock the tide set so strongly against us, that we found it impossible to make the harbour, as we lost ground every board, on which we"}, {"page_label": "Seite 251", "page_text": "NORTH-WEST COAST OF AMERICA. we hove the main top-sail to the mast, in order to trade with the Indians. A scene now commenced, which absolutely beggars all description, and with which we were so overjoyed, that we could scarcely believe the evidence of our senses. There were ten canoes about the ship, which contained, as nearly as I could estimate, 120 people j many of these brought most beautiful beaver cloaks; others excellent steins, and, in short, none came empty handed, and the rapidity with which they fold them, was a circumstance additionally pleasing; they fairly quarrelled with each other about which should fell his cloak first; and some actually threw their furs on board, if nobody was at hand to receive them ; but we took particular care to let none go from the vessel unpaid. Toes were almost the only article we bartered with on this occasion, and indeed they were taken so very eagerly, that there was not the least occasion to offer any thing else. In less than half an hour we purchased near 300 beaver skins, of an excellent quality; a circumstance which greatly raised our spirits, and the more, as both the plenty of fine furs, and the avidity of the natives in parting with them, were convincing proofs, that no traffic whatever had recently been carried on near this place, and consequently we might expect a continuation of this plentiful commerce. That thou mayest form some idea of the cloaks we purchased here, I shall just observe, that they generally contain three good sea otter skins, one of which is cut in two pieces, afterwards they are neatly sewed together, so as to form a square, and are loosely tied about the shoulders with small leather strings fastened on each side. 4 At three o'clock, our trade being entirely over, and the wind still against us, we made fail, and stood out of the bay, intending to C c try"}, {"page_label": "Seite 252", "page_text": "A VOYAGE TO THE try again for the harbour in the morning.

The wind continuing steady at North West, Captain Dixon judged it more advantageous for us to ply along stiore, as circumstances required, than come to anchor, especially as we had every reason to conclude, that the natives did not live together in one social community, but were scattered about in different tribes, and probably at enmity with each other.

Captain Dixon no sooner saw the fortified hut just mentioned, than this suspicion was strengthened, as it was, he said, built exactly on the plan of the hi pp ah of the savages at New Zealand. The people, on coming along-side, traded very quietly, and strongly importuned us by signs, to come on shore; at the same time giving us to understand (pointing towards the East) that if we visited that part of the coast, the inhabitants there would cut off our heads. This was an unquestionable proof, that they were at variance with their neighbours, and their hostile appearance sufficiently confirmed it, being well armed with knives and spears. I am not fond of hazarding conjeBures, yet I cannot help remarking, that though the behaviour of these people was harmless and inoffensive, yet their attempt to persuade us to go on shore, is an additional proof in favour of our suspicion ; they certainly wanted to decoy us to the hippah, and there, no doubt, we should have been instantly butchered.

There were likewise a few women amongst them, who all seemed pretty well advanced in years; their under lips were distorted in the fame manner as those of the women at Port Mulgrave, and Norfolk Sound, and the pieces of wood were particularly large.

In the morning of the 11 th of July, having a steady breeze at North West, we stood in for the land, which at noon bore from North 55 deg. West to South 74 deg. East. Our meridian altitude gave 52 deg. 50 min. North latitude, and our distance from shore was about two miles.

We kept close in with the shore during the afternoon, though the weather was still very hazy. A little before seven o'clock, the fog clearing up, we saw several canoes making towards us, on which we hauled by the wind, and hove to, in order to give them an opportunity of coming up with us: they were a different tribe from our last traders, and brought us several excellent cloaks, and some very good lkins, which we purchased on much the same terms as before. This party consisted of about thirty-six people, and, like the tribes we had recently traded with, were prepared for the reception of their adversaries. Before the day closed in, we had purchased every article the Indians had got to fell; yet they could not be prevailed on to quit the strip, though we made fail, and gave them to understand, that we should return the next day; yet they still kept up with the vessel. At length, about ten o'clock, a very thick fog coming on, they left us, and paddled towards the shore : we were now at least eight miles distant from the coast,, and it was a matter of doubt with many of us, whether these poor fellows would ever be able to find their way on shore, it being impossible to distinguish any object: twenty fathoms a-head of the vessel. During the night we hauled on a wind to the SouthWest as usual. From the 14th to the 20th, we had generally thick foggy weather, with a constant strong breeze at North West, and frequent intervening squalls.

North latitude ; and the mean of several sets of lunar observations gave 131 deg. 22 min. West longitude. The weather was not so constantly foggy, but that we frequently saw the land, and twice or thrice were close in with the shore, so that the natives might easily have come to us, but none appearing, we began seriously to think, that the Indians who left us in the evening of the 13th were lost at sea, and consequently no more would come near the vessel, as they might possibly conclude that we had destroyed their companions. Ojur latitude at noon on the 20th was 52 deg. 1 min. North ; so that we were only sixteen miles to the Southward of our observation on the 13th. The day being moderate and clear, we stood in for the land, and seeing several canoes making towards us, about one o'clock we hove to. When the canoes came along-side, we found the people to be the same that traded with us last, a circumstance which gave us great pleasure, our fears for their safety being groundless. What furs they now brought were of an inferior kind, consisting chiefly of old cloaks, pretty much wore ; these were generally purchased with brass pans, knives, and buckles. The Indians being stripped of all their furs, left the vessel immediately, and at four o'clock we made fail, stretching to the South West as usual.

In the evening we had 1787. a very heavy swell from West South West, which being met by the , J uly ' tide, caused the heaviest cross sea we had seen during the Voyage. The weather on the 2ad was moderate and hazy; our observation at noon gave 52 deg. 10 min. North latitude. During the afternoon we made short boards, in order to keep well in with the coast. In the morning of the 23d we had light winds, the weather still hazy. Our latitude at noon was 52 deg. 13 min. North. The afternoon proving tolerably clear, about seven o'clock we saw several canoes making towards us, on which we hcve to ; our distance' from shore was then about five miles. There were eight canoes, containing near one hundred people, many of whom had been with us on the 13th and 20th : they brought some pretty good cloaks, and a few good ikins, which we purchased for toes and buckles. During the night we hauled by the wind as usual, tacking occasionally, so as to keep near the land; the weather moderate and hazy. Towards noon on the 24th, the fog clearing up, we perceived several canoes putting off from shore, on which we lay to, in order to give them an opportunity of coming up with us. In less than an hour we had eleven canoes along-side, containing near 180 men, women, and children, which was by far the greatest concourse of people we had seen *t any one time, since we had fallen in with these fortunate islands; but we soon found that curiosity had chiefly induced the natives to pay us this visit, what they now brought to fell being merely the gleanings of the harvest we had plentifully reaped before : indeed till now, we had seldom seen any women or children"}, {"page_label": "Seite 268", "page_text": "A VOYAGE TO THE children in the trading parties; for the men probably expecting to meet with their enemies, for the most part left the women and children behind, as an useless incumbrance.

At eight o'clock the Eastermost point of land bore North 40 deg. East, about four miles distant. From this point is a range of broken rocks, which run out more than a mile from the land. It being evident that we could expect no more trade on this side the islands, Captain Dixon purposed standing round the point, in order to try what the opposite side afforded. During the night we snade occasional boards, as it was judged most prudent to double the rocky point in the day-time. The morning of the 25th was cloudy, with a moderate breeze at West North West.

It was Captain Dixon's intention, if the wind permitted, to go round these islands, that we might not only clear the inhabitants of their furs, but be able exactly to determine their extent, for the information of future navigators j at present, however, our progress was very slow. About eleven o'clock on the 27th, we had four canoes along-fide, containing about thirty people, several of whom we knew to be our old friends; they brought several good cloaks and skins, which shewed that the trade on this fide of these islands was far from being exhausted. In the afternoon three other canoes came to us, bringing several excellent skins, which was an additional encouragement for us to proceed. Our latitude at noon was 52 deg. 18 min.

The day clearing up, we saw land to the Eastward, about ten leagues distant, on which we sounded with a line df thirty fathom, over a shingly bottom ; our latitude at noon was 52 deg. 57 min. North. In the afternoon we had light basti ng winds, with constant drizzling rain. The tide setting us to the Eastward, -we had soundings from twenty-four to fourteen fathom water, over a bottom of fluid and small pebble stones. The land in fight to the Eastward we judged to be the Continent, and the nearer we ap- proeched it, our soundings lessened. Towards six o'clock the tide turned, and now setting from that land which we supposed to be the Continent, it frequently drove large patches of sea-weed, long grafs, and pieces of wood, by the ' vessel, which made us conclude, that there is a large river setting out from that part of the coast. The river called Eos Reys, by Du Fonte, is near this-place j* and though what he fays about it > is almost incredible, yet, from the above circumstance, it appears very probable, that there are deep inlets into the country; and it is to be lamented, that we had not an opportunity of examining that part of the coast. The morning of the 29th was moderate and cloudy; the wind being light and variable, we tacked occasionally, in order to stand well in with the shore, that no opportunity of trading might be lost.

In this situation we saw high land to the North West, near thirty leagues distant, and which evidently was the fame we had seen on the ist of July. This circumstance clearly proved, the land we had been coasting along for near a month, to be a group of istands. Early in the afternoon we saw several canoes coming from sliore, and by three o'clock we had no less than eighteen along-side, containing more than 200 people, chiefly men : this was not only the greatest concourse of traders we had seen, but what rendered the circumstance additionally pleating, was the quantity of excellent furs they brought us, our trade now being equal, if not superior to that we met with in Cloak Bay, both in number of skins, and the facility with which the natives traded, so that all of us were busily employed, and our articles of traffic exhibited in the greatest variety ; toes, hatchets, howels, tin kettles, pewter basons, brass pans, buckles, knives, rings, &c. being preferred by turns, according to the fancy of our numerous visitants. Amongst these traders was the old Chief, whom we had seen oil the other side these islands, and who now appearing to be a person of the first consequence, Captain Dixon permitted him to come on board. The moment he got on the quarter deck he began to tell a long story, the purport of which was, that he had lost in battle the cap which we had given him; and to convince us how true this story was, he shewed us several wounds he had received in defending his property; notwithstanding this, he begged for another cap, intimating at the fame time, that he would never lose it but with his life. Our Captain, willing to gratify his ambition, made him a present of another cap, and we presently found it was not bestowed in vain, for he became extremely useful to us in our traf- E e sic;"}, {"page_label": "Seite 274", "page_text": "A VOYAGE TO THE fic; whenever any dispute or mistake arose in the unavoidable: hurry occasioned by so great a number of traders, they always referred the matter to him, and were constantly satisfied with his determination. On our pointing to the Eastward, and asking the old man whether we should meet with any furs there, he gave us to understand, that it was a different nation from his, and that he did not even understand their language, but was always at war with them ; that he had killed great numbers, and had many of their heads in his possession. The old fellow seemed to take particular pleasure in relating these circumstances, and took uncommon pains to make us comprehend his meaning ; he closed his relation with advising us not to come near that part of the coast, for that the inhabitants would certainly destroy us, I endeavoured to learn how they disposed of the bodies of their enemies who were stain in battle ; and though I could not understand the Chief clearly enough positively to assert, that they are feasted on by the victors; yet there is too much reason to fear, that this horrid custom is practised on this part of the coast ; the heads are always preserved, as standing trophies of victory. Of all the Indians we had seen, this Chief had the most savage aspect, and his whole appearance sufficiently marked him as a proper person to lead a tribe of cannibals. His stature was above the common size ; his body spare and thin, and though at first sight he appeared lank and emaciated, yet his step was bold and firm, and his limbs apparently strong and muscular; his eyes were large and gog- ling, and seemed ready to start out of their sockets; his forehead deeply 2 wrinkled,"}, {"page_label": "Seite 275", "page_text": "NORTH-WEST COAST OF AMERICA. 2i§ wrinkled, not merely by age, but from a continual frown ; all this, 1787. joined to a long visage, hollow cheeks, high elevated cheek bones, > ^ uly * j and a natural ferocity of temper, formed a countenance not easily beheld without some degree of emotion : however, he proved very useful in conducting our traffic with his people, and the intelligence he gave us, and the methods he took to make himself understood, shewed him to possess a strong natural capacity. Besides the large quantity of furs we got from this party, (at least 350 skins) they brought several racoon cloaks, each cloak consisting of seven racoon skins, neatly sewed together; they had. also a good quantity of oil in bladders of various sizes, from a pint to near a gallon, which we purchased for rings and buttons : this oil appeared to be of a most excellent kind for the lamp, was perfectly sweet, and chiefly collected from the fat of animals. By seven o'clock we had entirely stripped our numerous traders of every saleable article, on which they left us, and paddled for the shore. The wind during the night being variable, we tacked occasionally, in order to keep as near the coast as was consistent with prudence.

There is every reason to suppose, not only h -from the number of inlets we met with in coasting along the shore, but from our meeting the fame inhabitants on the opposite fides of the coast, that this is not one continued land, but rather forms a group of islands and as such, we distinguished them by the name of Queen Charlotte's IJlands . They are situated from 51 deg. 42 min. to §4 deg. 24 mm. North latitude ;and from 130 deg. to 133 deg. 30 min. West longitude. The land, in some places, is considerably elevated, but not mountainous, and is totally covered with pines, which in many places afford a pleasing contrast to the snow that perpetually covers the higher grounds. The weather, whilst we were cruizing here, was generally mild -and temperate, the mean of the thermometer 54 deg. The whole time we coasted along from Cloak Bay to Cape St. James, the wind was generally steady, at North West and West North West; but no sooner had we doubled the Cape, and got to the North East side of the land, than we fell in with light variable winds and intervening calms. The number of people we saw during the whole of our traffic, was about eight hundred and fifty; and if we suppose an equal number to be left on shore, it will amount to one thousand seven hundred inhabitants, which, I have reason to think, will be found the extreme number of people inhabiting these islands, including women and children. The great plenty of furs we met with here, sufficiently indicated that these people have had no intercourse whatever with any civilized nation; and I doubt not, but we may justly claim the honour of adding these islands to the geography of this part of the coast.

The women distort the under lip in the same manner with those at Norfolk Sound, but with this difference, that here, this wooden ornament seems to be wore by all the sex indiscriminately, whereas at Norfolk Sound it is confined to those of superior rank. The Indians in general are very jealous of their women, and would seldom permit them to come on board ; but this was not altogether the cafe with these savages, many of whom not only permitted, but urged their females to come on board, whenever invited by our people; but we soon found that they were not instigated to pay these visits from any amorous disposition, but merely for the sake of plunder, as they were by far the most rapacious thieves we had seen, stealing every thing indiscriminately which they could lay their hands on, and that with a degree of dexterity which would not disgrace a disciple of the 'JuJiitia hulk. Notwithstanding the general tenor of these women's behaviour, we met with one instance of feeling and sensibility amongst them which perfectly astonished us, and is not, perhaps, always to be seen amongst the sex in civilized countries. It was on the 24th of July, (as I have already related) when the natives visited us principally through curiosity, that a Chief and his wife were very desirous to fee the ship ; Captain Dixon, willing to gratify them in this particular, and thinking that a sight of the vessel would be a standing subject for them to F f \" talk 17S7.

By degrees he grew easy, and was prevailed on to go down into the cabin; having staid there some time, he came upon deck, and after satisfying his curiosity with looking at various things, went into his canoe very well pleased. The woman, after, giving her infant a maternal kiss, came over the side without the least hesitation, and when she got on the quarter deck gave us to understand that she was only come to fee the vessel, and with a modest diffidence in her looks endeavoured to bespeak our indulgence and permission for that purpose. She \" was neatly dressed after their fashion; her under garment, which was made of fine tanned leather, fat close to her body, and reached from her neck to the calf of her leg: her cloak or upper garment was rather coarser, and sat loose like a petticoat, and tied with leather strings. Having taken notice of every thing which seemed to attract her attention, Captain Dixon made her a present of a string of beads for an ornament to each ear, and a number of buttons, with which she was highly pleased, and made her acknowledgments in the best manner she was able. She was scarcely got into the canoe before a number of women flocked about her, and seeing the beads in her ears began to talk very earnestly ; most probably to tax her with incontinency, for she immediately clasped her infant to her breast with unspeakable fondness, burst into a flood of tears, and it was a considerable time before the southings os"}, {"page_label": "Seite 283", "page_text": "SSHfiaB mmmm r,! if, i I >. f _ '.fju j'firy'c/>- V>7 tf.-1/^.1 <>> ///'//r' fr/ f rf///<fs// f/ ;///</ /v/"}, {"page_label": "Seite 284", "page_text": "$4 X < : *-AlP '& 1 %*?*% FM ? i\"Wn HWWA mmmB w?m UP tf ' %fi h\" \"£■<. i&mn ■e^Wi"}, {"page_label": "Seite 285", "page_text": "NORTH-WEST COAST OF AMERICA. of her hulhand and the apologies of her friends could bring back her former chearfulnefs and tranquility.

To those who are fond of tracing human nature through all its various stages, a circumstance of this fort would be peculiarly pleasing, but I shall forbear to expatiate on the subject, and leave thee to make thy own comments on it. Though every tribe we met with at these Islands is governed by its respective Chief, yet they are divided into families, each of which appears to have regulations and a kind of subordinate government of its own : the Chief usually trades for the whole tribe j but I have sometimes observed that when his method of barter has been disapproved of, each separate family has claimed a right to dispose of their own furs, and the Chief always complied with this request; whether or no he receives any emolument on these occasions I cannot determine.

If these circumstances are duly considered, I trust thou wilt not accuse me of inattention, though it is not in my power to give thee any specimen of tire language spoken by these people; however, from what observations I was able to make, it seems something similar to that of the inhabitants in Norfolk Sound. In addition to what I have occasionally said, respecting the savage temper and brutal disposition of the people at these islands, I cannot help remarking, that there is a kind of ferocity even in their manner of singing. It must be allowed, that their songs are performed with regularity, and in good time, but they are entirely destitute of that pleasing modulation and harmony of cadence, which we had invariably been accustomed to hear in the songs at other parts of the coast. The number of sea-otter skins purchased by us at Queen Charlotte's Islands, was no less than 1,821, many of them very fine ; other furs are found in less variety here than in many other parts of the coast, the few racoons before mentioned, a few pine martin, and some seals, being the only kinds we saw.

In the forenoon of the 5th, having still a fresti Westerly breeze,, we bore away to the South East; and at four in the afternoon changed our course to East by North. The weather being thick and hazy, we tacked occasionally during the night. Early in the morning of the 6th, we made sail, and steered our course, with a fresh breeze at North-West. Our latitude at noon was 49 deg. 48 min. North, which was only twelve miles to the Northward of King George's Sound, but we were a considerable distance to the Westward of it. The afternoon being tolerably clear, at six o'clock, we saw Woody Point bearing North West by West, about four leagues distant, and a split rock off the point, North 28 deg. West. At eight o'clock, we hauled by the wind to the South West: during the night we had light airs, with calms by turns. The morning of the 7th was thick and foggy, with a heavy swell from the Westward, and quite calm. At ten o'clock a light breeze sprung up at South East, and the fog cleared up.

The morning of the 8th was moderate and cloudy, a light breeze still at South East. A ten o'clock we saw a sail to the South East, and presently afterwards, a smaller vessel in company*. This gave us some hopes that they might possibly be the King George and her long boat. We were steering East North East, and kept on our course, as we plainly saw the vessels were bearing down upon us ; on the their nearer approach, we found that it could not be Captain Portlock, as the small sail was much too large for his long boat. Various now were our conjectures who they could be, or what country they came from; and Captain Dixon wishing to be satis fed in this particular, gave orders to tack, and fire a gun to leeward. The small vessel immediately answered this signal, and hoisted our Company's colours :> by twelve o'clock they spoke us, and we learned, to our great joy, that they were from London, and fitted out by our Owners. The ship was called the Prince of Wales, Captain Col- linett; and the stoop, the Princess Royal, Captain Duncan. We had the pleasure of hearing in general, that our friends in England were in good health; but few of us had such particulars as could have been wislied for, as (by tome mistake or other) we were expected to arrive in London river the latter end of this season. These vessels left England in September, 1786, and had settled a factory at Statens land, for the purpose of collecting seal skin and oil; from thence they had made the best of their way to King George's Sound, without touching at any other place.

On our enquiry what course they steered after doubling Cape Horn, we were informed that they crosled the line about 116 deg. West longitude. In this situation they fell in'with light baffling winds and frequent calms, attended with close gloomy sultry weather, and much rain, which certainly occasioned the very severe sickness that had prevailed amongst them. We crossed the line in April, 1786, nearly in the same longitude, and met with light variable winds and gloomy weather, 'till we stretched considerably to the Westward, when we again had a regular trade-wind. These circumstances evidently sliew that such a course ought to be avoided ; and Captain Dixon observed that it would be by far the best for all vessels bound to the North-West coast of America, after doubling Cape Horn, to steer directly for . the Marquesas; there they might obtain refresliments, and at the same time would be so well to the Westward, that in the farther prosecution of their voyage, he had every reason to think, they would escape those climates which we had experimentally found to be so very unhealthy. Mr. John Etches, brother to our managing owner, (who was on board the Prince of Wales) informed me that they had been near a month in King George's Sound, but had done very little business, having found a strip there called the Imperial Eagle, commanded by a Captain Berkley.

T wo vessels from Bombay were at King George's Sound in the summer of 1786, and left one of their people behind; this man was found here by Captain Berkely, who gave the following account of him. \" His name is John M'Key; he was born in Ireland, and went to Bombay in the East India Company's service. Two vessels (viz. the Captain Cook, Captain Boric; and the Experiment, Captain Guise) were sitting out in 1785, on an expedition to the North West coast of America; that he engaged on board the Captain Cook as Surgeon. They sailed from Bombay the 28th of November, 1785, and arrived at King George's Sound the 27th 1 of June, 1786. That being very ill of a purple fever he was left behind for the recovery of his health, at the request of Mr. Strange, the Supercargo to both vessels. Mr. Strange desired him to learn the language and to ingratiate himself with the natives, so that if any other vessels should touch there he might prevent them from purchasing any furs, promising at the same time to return for him the^ ensuing spring.

That the natives had stripped him of his cloaths, and obliged him to adopt their mode of dress and filthi- nefs of manners; and that he was now a perfect master of their language, and well acquainted with their temper and disposition. He had made frequent incursions into the interior parts of the country about King George's Sound, and did not think any part of it was the Continent of America, but a chain of detached islands. Mr. Etches (from whom I had this intelligence) assured me that no great dependance could be placed on M'Key's story, he being a very ignorant young fellow, and frequently contradicting himself ; but that entire credit might be given to that part of it respecting his adopting the manners of the natives, as he was equally slovenly and dirty with the filthiest of them all. His knowledge of the language was greatly short of what he boasted; neither was he very contented in his situation, for he gladly embraced Captain Berkley's offer of taking him on board, and seemed delighted to think he was going to leave so uncomfortable a place : however, admitting him to be possessed of but an ordinary capacity, he certainly must be better acquainted with the people here, from more than a year's residence amongst them, than any occasional visitor could possibly be; and there can be no doubt but that Captain Berkley found him extremely useful in managing his traffic with the natives.

The celebrated Russian navi- > - gator, Beering, in the year 1741, fell in with the land in the latitude 58 deg. 28 min. North, and anchored in 59 deg. 18 min. But the account which is publilhed of his voyage is very imperfect and inaccurate. The Spaniards too, are probably well acquainted with the coast a little to the Southward of King George's Sound, and about Cape Edgcombe, at both which places they anchored in 1775; and I have reason to think that their knowledge of this part of the continent is confined to those particular situations. What has been already said will shew that the principal places ascertained with accuracy by Captain Cook, were King George's and Prince William's Sounds, and the river named after him j and no doubt it was from the plenty of furs he found in those harbours that this trade was first Jet on foot. Our rivals frorh the Indies certainly drew their information from the fame source; and this, in some respects, has not been unlucky on our side; for they, not expecting to meet with furs in any other places than those mentioned by Cook, quietly fat down with what they could get in those harbours, and consequently we had to seek for other resources, or return home empty handed. By this means we fell in with Queen Charlotte's Islands, which (as I have already shewn) surpassed our most sanguine expectations, and afforded a greater quantity of furs than, perhaps, any place hitherto known.

North latitude; and from 126 to 155 deg. West longitude. <1 This vast country (with very little deviation) has the appearance of one continued forest, being covered with pines of different species, and these intermixed with alder, birch, witch-hazle, &c. besides various kinds of brush-wood ; and the vallies and low grounds, which are exposed to the fun, and sheltered from the wind, afford wild currants, gooseberries, rafberries, and various other flowery shrubs. The foil on the hills is a kind of compost,, consisting of rotten moss and old decayed trees. This is frequently washed down into the vallies by the sudden melting of the snow, and there incorporating with a light sand, forms a foil in which most of our garden productions might be cultivated with success. The climate, as may be expected, is various but; I do not think it so temperate even in King George's Sound as in England* for the hills of a moderate height are perpetually covered with snow.

There is little doubt of variety of metals and minerals being found here. I have already observed,'that we found a vein of coals in Cook's Rives . The paint used by the natives in daubing their faces and bodies, appears chiefly to be black lead and red oker; and we frequently saw large circular wreaths of copper both at Norfolk Sound and Queen Charlotte's Islands, which did not appear to be foreign manufacture, but twisted into that shape by the natives themselves, to wear as an ornament about the neck. What number of inhabitants this extent of coast may contain, is not easy to determine with any degree of certainty; but from a moderate computation, there cannot be less than 10,000; indeed, appearances might warrant the conjecture of their being considerably more, as the women appear very prolific, (every tribe we saw having numbers of young children) and the people are totally free from that long catalogue of diseases, which luxury and intemperance have introduced amongst more civilized nations. But then it must be remembered, that neighbouring tribes are generally at war with each other, and these commotions, both from the nature of their weapons, and the savage disposition of the people, must be attended with fatal consequences ; besides, there is reason to suppose that numbers are lost at sea, as they go out to a very considerable distance a fishing, and should bad weather suddenly come on, it is impossible for their canoes to live.

A love of dirt and filth is universally predominant all over the coast. In regard to their complexion, it is no easy matter to determine what cast that is; but if I may judge from the few people I saw tolerably clean, these Indians are very little darker than the Europeans in general. The hair of both sexes is long and black, and would be an ornament to them, were it not for the large quantities of grease and red oker constantly rubbed into it, which not only gives it a disgusting appearance, but affords a never-failing harbour for vermin. Sometimes, indeed, the women keep their hair in decent order, parting it from the forehead to the crown, and tying it behind after the manner of a club. The young men have no beards, and I was at first inclined to think that this arose from a natural want of hair on that part, but I was soon undeceived in this particular, for all the men we saw, who were advanced in years, had beards all over the chin, and some of them whiskers on each side the upper lip. As this supposed defect amongst the natives of America has occasioned much speculative enquiry amongst the learned and ingenious, I took every opportunity of learning how it was occasioned, and was given to understand, that the young men got rid of their beards by plucking them out, but that as they advance in years, the hair is suffered to grow.

Besides this, some of the more civilized sort, particularly those in Cook's River, wear a small piece of fur tied round the waist, when the heat of the day causes them to throw their coat aside, or they are disposed to sell it. The dress of the women differs in some respects from that of the men : their under garment is made of fine tanned leather, and covers the body from the neck to the ancle, being tied in different parts to make it sit close: over this is tied a piece of tanned leather like an apron, and which reaches no higher than the waist; the upper garment is made in much the fame manner as the men's coats, and generally of tanned leather, the women not caring to wear furs, as they were always unwilling to be stripped of their garments, which, should they happen to be worth purchasing, their husbands alway insisted on their being fold; indeed, the deportment of the women in general was decent, modest, and becoming. It might be imagined, that the children of these savages would enjoy the free and unrestrained use of their limbs from their earliest infancy; this, however, is not altogether the cafe: three pieces of bark are fastened together, so as to form a kind of chair, the infant, after being wrapped in furs, is put into this chair, and Z ashed so close, that it cannot alter its posture even with struggling;' and the chair is so contrived, that when a mother wants to feed her child, or give it the breast, there is no occasion to release it from its shackles.

Their songs generally consist of several stanzas, 1787. to each of which is added a chorus. The beginning of each stanza is given out by the Chief alone, after which both men and women join and sing in octaves, beating time regularly with their hands, or paddles : meanwhile the Chief shakes his rattle, and makes a thousand ridiculous gesticulations, singing at intervals in different notes from the rest; and 4 this mirth generally continues near half an hour without intermission.

Whether or no they make use of any hieroglyphics to perpetuate the memory of events, I cannot fay, though their numerous drawings of birds and sissies, and their carved representations of animals and human faces, might, perhaps, warrant a supposition of the kind. Many of these carvings are well proportioned, and executed with a considerable degree of ingenuity, which appears rather extraordinary amongst a people so remote from civilized refinement. But then we must consider that this art is far from being in its infancy ; a fondness for carving and sculpture was discovered amongst these people by Captain Cook: iron implements were then also in use; and their knives are so very thin that they bend them into a variety of forms, which answer their every purpose nearly as well as if they had recourse to a carpenter's tool Hh 2 chest."}, {"page_label": "Seite 304", "page_text": "2 44 1787.

At what period iron was introduced on this coast is very uncertain, but it must doubtless be a considerable time ago ; and I may venture to assert that their implements are not of English manufacture, so that their is little doubt of their being obtained from the Russians. The only implement I saw, (iron excepted) was a toe made of jasper, the same as those used by the New Zealanders. The ingenuity of these people is not confined to devices in wood, or drawings on bark; they manufacture a kind of variegated blanket or cloak, something like our horse cloths; they do not appear to be wove, but made entirely by hand, and are neatly finished: I imagine these cloaks are made of wool collected from the skins of beasts killed in the chace ; they are held in great estimation, and only wore on extraordinary occasions. Besides the skin coats and cloaks wore in common, they have large coats purposely for war, made of the elk skin, tanned, and wore double, sometimes threefold. Their weapons are spears fixed to a pole six or eight feet long, and a kind of short dagger, which is wore in a leather cafe, and tied round the body: to this dagger a leather thong is fastened, at the end of which is a hole for the middle finger, the leather is afterwards twisted round the wrist, in order to fix the dagger firm in the hand; so that the warrior loses his weapon only with his life. Food in the winter season consists chiefly of dried fifli, but when the time of hunting comes on, they have greater variety, amongst which broiled seal seems to be reckoned a most delicious repast; they sometimes offered us pieces of it, and on our refusing this dainty, always looked at us with a mixture of astonishment and contempt."}, {"page_label": "Seite 305", "page_text": "NORTH-WEST COAST OF AMERICA.

Though these poor savages are in their general manners truly in a state of uncultivated barbarism, yet in cm instance they can boast of a refinement equal to that of more polite nations, and that is gaming , which is carried on here to as great a pitch (comparatively speaking) as at any of our moderate fashionable clubs. The only gaming implements I saw, were fifty-two small round bits of wood, about the size of your middle finger, and differently marked with red paint. A game is played by two persons with these pieces of wood, and chiefly consists in placing them in a variety of positions, but I am unable to describe it minutely.

Time is calculated by moons, and remarkable events are remembered with ease for one generation, but whether for any longer period is very doubtful. Sea otter skins are the staple commodity in the fur trade, the other varieties we have met with I have before enumerated, and I was informed by Mr. Etches, that King George's Sound produced as many different forts of skins as Cook's River: I have also taken notice of the articles most acceptable in barter, and shall only add on that head, that copper is almost the only article in request at King George's Sound; and though saws are obviously of the greatest use to the Indians, yet we found them so little va- 1 lued,"}, {"page_label": "Seite 306", "page_text": "246 A VOYAGE TO THE \\ 1787. lued, that they would scarcely take a saw for a seal skin; but time Anfflfh u f e win no doubt teach them the value both of these and other utensils left by us on the coast.

For some days past, we had seen an innumerable quantity of curious animal and vegetable substances floating on the water, called by sailors, Portugueze men of war; the bottom part is about two inches long, oval, and of a purple colour; the upper part is quite thin and expanded, nearly in the shape of a fan.

By ten o'clock a vast number of canoes were along-side us, and the Indians traded very eagerly, many of them climbing up the ship's side for that purpose, and numbers merely to gratify their curiosity, and look for any thing they could run away with. One of this last description, watching his opportunity whilst all of us were busily engaged with the traders, snatched a poker from the Armourer's forge and jumped over board with it. We called to him repeatedly to bring it back, but all in vain, the fellow swam off with it, and seemed remarkably well pleased with his acquisition : presently one of the canoes picked him up, and they paddled away for the Ihore. On this our Captain determined to make an example of him, and the more so, as if he was suffered to escape with impunity, we should find it impossible to trade with such a multiplicity of people, without being continually subject to their depredations: on which several muskets were fired at the thief, and we presently, saw that he was very severely wounded, by his bleeding profusely.

Our Surgeon dressed the wound in the best manner he was able, and we sent the poor fellow away; but before he left us, he petitioned the Captain for a toe, and received it. * The Indians were not in the least intimidated by this circumstance, but traded with us presently afterwards, as if nothing had happened. It was not our Captain's intention to anchor at this island, but ply off and on occasionally, in order to procure a good supply of hogs and vegetables, and all the line we could meet with, this part of Owhyhee affording great plenty of fishing-lines, which we had found, by experience, to be particularly useful in making ropes for various purposes. At noon we saw Mowee, the East end of which bore North 56 deg. West, about twelve leagues distant, and the extremes of Owhyhee, from South 76 deg. West to North 30 deg.

The weather during the 7 th being moderate, we plied occasionally, as best suited our conveniency for trading with the people, who kept supplying us with hogs and vegetables; so that by the evening we had got an ample supply of provisions.

A vast number of canoes came along-side us from this part of the island, and we purchased a good quantity of line for the ship's use.

At noon, the West end of Ranai bore North 10 deg. West, about ten miles distant. During the afternoon we had several canoes from Ranai along-side, which brought us a number of fishing-lines, but little besides : these we purchased with small toes. At six o'clock a bluff-head on the West side of Ranai, much resembling Beachy-Head, bore North 6 deg. East, five miles distant. In the evening we had several heavy squalls, which caused us to clofe-reef the topsails, and single-reef the mainsail; but about midnight the weather grew moderate, and at day-light in the morning of the 10th, we set all sail on seeing Whahoo right a-head.

Our intention was to stay here no longer than was necessary to procure wood and water, as we knew from fad experience that it was scarcely possible to lay here for any length of time without injuring our cables, not only on account of the foul bottom, but from the heavy swell constantly setting into the bay at South East. 1 There was several canoes along-fide, some of which we sent on shore for water ; but few of the people brought any, saying that every thing was tabooed. During the afternoon our people were employed in setting up the rigging fore and aft.

The King brought a fine hog and some cocoa-nuts as a present: but it was evident that he meant to regulate his conduct towards us by the reception we gave him, and that we might expect our wants supplied in proportion as he approved of our presents : he enquired repeatedly after Captain Portlock, and appeared very anxious to fee him. Myaro, and several of the Chiefs asked after Pia- pia, and seemed well pleased to hear of his being at Atoui. After Teereteere had satisfied his curiosity, and Captain Dixon made him a present of some toes and other trifling ai tides, he went on shore; and we presently found the good effects of our bounty, great numbers of the natives flocking to us with water, so that by sun-set we had filled fourteen butts. By day-light in the morning of the 12th, we were surrounded by canoes full of water, so that the remainder of our empty casks were presently filled, and many of the poor Indians emptied their gourds; into the sea, when they found we had no occasion for any more. Our next object was to procure wood, which our friends no sooner knew than they paddled away for the shore, and in less than an hour began to supply us very briskly. They also brought a great quantity of fruit, somewhat resembling a nectarine, and which I had not noticed when last at this island: they eat very agi eeably, and are cool, juicy, and refreshing.

When the King came on board, he seemed to be sorry that we should leave Whahoo so soon, and endeavoured to persuade us that his only motive in paying this visit was to bid us farewell: but it was easy to perceive that interest principally brought him on board; and that he was unwilling we should leave the island, and have all our wants supplied so very expeditiously, without making some addition to our former presents; though, to do him justice, * no demand of the kind was directly made; but he frequently insinuated, that our being so speedily supplied with wood and water, was in consequence of his immediate orders for that purpose; and that the same respectful attention should be sliewn to Po Pote, whenever he arrived. As Tereteere seemed to lay great stress on this last circumstance, our Captain made him a present of a few axes and saws, with which he was pleased to the highest degree imaginable. Our course being near that part of the island where the King usually resided, he staid on board some time, and was much delighted to fee the ship under sail.

About five o'clock, our old friend Long-shanks came on board; he was so rejoiced to fee his former acquaintance, that tears ran down his cheeks, and it was some time before he became perfectly calm and collected. From him we learned that Abbenooe was on shore at Attoui, and not at Oneehow, as we had been informed. The little breeze we had during the afternoon dying away, at fix o'clock we came to with the small bower, in nineteen fathom water, over a sandy bottom, about two miles to the Eastward of our former situation. Soon after this Tyheira came on board, and (on our asking after Abbenooe) began to tell us a very lamentable story, the purport of which was, that since We left Atoui, a ship had been there; that the Captain used the inhabitants very ill, and even killed several of them; that on this account his father durst not come to us, not knowing our vessel at so great a distance. Captain Dixon told him, that no trade whatever should be carried on until Abbenooe had been on board; on which Tyheira immediately sent a canoe to fetch his father, and at the fame time hoisted a signal, to let him know that he might come safely. This had the desired effect, for in less than half an hour we had the pleasure of seeing our good friend Abbenooe on board, and he was no less pleased to fee his old acquaintance again; but seemed sorry that Captain Portlock (or Po Pote, as he called him) was not with us.

On our asking Abbenooe about this circumstance, he informed us that the Nootka had left Atoui twenty days, and that the Captain was enou , ora bad man, and had not given any present whatever, though he had been plentifully supplied with every refreshment the island afforded. Our Captain's intention was not to stay here any longer than was necessary to procure a good supply of hogs, and as many vegetables as would serve the ship's company whilst they kept good, and indeed this seemed likely to detain us but a very short time, for early in the morning of the 17th we were surrounded with canoes, filled with taro, potatoes, cocoa-nuts, and sugar-cane: many of them had fine large hogs, particularly Abbenooe, Tyhei- ra, Long-fhanks, and old Toe-Toe, the Chief who used formerly to supply us so plentifully with taro. We presently purchased more hogs than we could conveniently carry away alive: on this our Captain ordered the people to kill and salt as many for sea- store as were sufficient to fill two puncheons. Early in the morning of the 18th our decks were crouded with vifitors; for, although it had been our constant custom when at these islands before, to admit very few people on board, yet at this time it could scarcely be avoided, especially as Captain Portlock was absent, and we were willing to shew every attention in our power to all those who had rendered any little services to either vessel.

She is a very pretty modest looking woman, and seems to regard her children with a fondness truly maternal: Tyheira, by way of paying a compliment to our Captain, has named his eldest boy Po Pote y after Capt. Portlock, and the younger Ditteana, after Capt. Dixon. Abbenooe informed us, that the King proposed coming on board in the course of the forenoon, and about ten o'clock 'Tiara made his appearance in a large double canoe, accompanied by another, in which were his daughter and two nieces. The attendants on these great persons were very numerous, and joined in a heeva y or song, on their coming on board, superior to any thing of the kind I ever heard at these islands. The king was greatly pleased to see us again, and enquired particularly after Po Pote. On being told that we should stay no longer than to procure a supply of provisions, he seemed solicitous to accommodate us with every thing the island afforded, and indeed all the Chiefs vied with each other in speedily supplying our various wants; even interest seemed to be forgot in the good na- tured bustle of kind and friendly offices. Amongst the many instances of kindness and good natured attention we met with at this time from the Chiefs in general, I cannot omit mentioning an action of Long-stianks, as it does him the greatest honour, and would reflect credit even on a person of education and refined sensibility.

On going down between decks, he met with the Carpenter, who had been troubled with a lingering disorder for a considerable time, and at present was very weak and poorly. His pale countenance and emaciated figure affected poor Long-shanks very sensibly; a tear of pity stole unheeded down his cheek, and he began to enquire about his complaint in a tone of tenderness and compassion : seeing him very weak and infirm, he gently chafed and pressed the sinews and muscles of his legs and thighs, and gave him all the consolation in his power. Presently afterwards he came upon deck, called his canoe, and went on shore in a hurry, without taking leave of any person on the quarterdeck, which was contrary to his usual custom ; but he returned very shortly, bringing a fine fowl along with him, which he immediately carried down to the Carpenter, told him to have it dressed directly, and he hoped it would make him better in a day or two. This circumstance strews, that these people are far from being destitute of the fine feelings of human nature, and at the same time may lead one to imagine that diseases are not very uncommon amongst them. About noon a fresh breeze springing up from the Northward, Captain Dixon wished to embrace this opportunity of weighing anchor; but, on looking over our stock of vegetables, it was judged necessary to procure a further supply, as we not only wanted them for the ship's use, but also to feed the hogs, of which we had near eighty on board, large and small..

The expedition and dispatch with which we got this last taro, and their free and generous manner in bringing it on board, both surprized and pleased us ; and our Captain was not flow in making suitable returns. To the King he gave a pabou, a large baize cloak edged with ribbon, and a very large toe, which pleased him so much, that he began to think himself the greatest monarch in the universe. The other Chiefs were rewarded with toes, axes, and saws, entirely to their satisfaction. The ladies, too, (of whom we had no small number of considerable rank on board) were liberally ornamented with buttons and beads. In short, all parties were perfectly pleased, and were profuse in their professions of kindness and acknowledgment.

The particular extent of each island I cannot give thee, as thou mayest know from the tenor of my former letters that our acquaintance with the major part of them is very superficial: on this head I shall just observe, that Owhyhee is the farthest to the Southward and Eastward, the south pcfint being in 18 deg. 54 min.

Tahoura is the Westermost island of the groupe, and I believe is uninhabited. These islands in general are mountainous, and some of them remarkably so. Captain King* estimates Monakaah and Monaroa, two mountains of Owhyhee, to be considerably higher than the famous Picque of Teneriffe and the high land on Mowee seems little inferior in height to either of them. I have before observed that the summits of the two former are perpetually covered with snow, and yet the numerous and well cultivated plantations round their base, and the exuberant soilage of the trees with which their sides are covered, totally destroy every idea of Winter.

Though these islands are situated within the tropics, yet experience has ihewn us that trade winds are far from being constant here, particularly to the Westward of Whahoo: the weather too is frequently unsettled; and another very great inconvenience attending these islands, is the want of a good harbour; though in the summer months I doubt not but vessels may lay either in Karakakoa Bay, Owhyhee; or Wymoa Bay, Atoui, with great safety. I imagine the climate is much the same as that of tropical islands in general. The mean of the thermometer during our stay here was 80 degrees. Owhyhee is by far the most plentiful island of the whole; we may indeed afiign as one reason for this, that it is larger than any two of the rest, but then its inhabitants are equally numerous in proportion to its extent, and I am inclined to think they are much more so, consequently the land is more universally cultivated than at any of the other islands, which at once accounts for the great plenty of vegetables, &c. met with here.

T HE circumstance which renders Owhyhee peculiarly eligible to touch at, is the great number of fine hogs it affords : fowls too are in great plenty here. In regard to vegetables, breadfruit, potatoes, and plantains, are the most plentiful j taro is more scarce, and rather indifferent, and there are very few yams , , t.m-. to be met with. ^ Atoui is certainly the second island for refreshments, and is in some respects superior to Owhyhee : it produces many fine hogs, the greatest abundance of excellent taro, together with potatoes and plantains. Cocoa-nuts are met with here in greater abundance than, perhaps, at all the other islands together; and there is plenty of fine salt, which is peculiarly useful in curing pork for sea-store : add to this, plenty of excellent water is easily procured, and at least a temporary supply of wood. The Chiefs are easily attached to your interest, and by that means every business is carried on with the greatest order and regularity. Whahoo, though greatly inferior to either of the islands just mentioned in regard to hogs or vegetables, yet it confessedly claims a first place for supplying those most necessary articles, wood and water; and I have reason to think that in a few years it will equal Atoui in point of fertility.

The bay we lay in, and Whititte bay in particular, are crouded with new plantations, laid out in the most regular order, and which seem to be in a very flourishing state of cultivation. Oneehow is remarkable for the great quantity of excellent yams it produces; there is also a sweet root called tee, or tea, found here: it is generally about the thickness of a person's wrist, but sometimes much larger, and is generally baked by the natives previous to their bringing it for barter. This root is of a wet, clammy nature, and with proper management makes excellent beer.-The other islands in general produce a few hogs, together with potatoes, bread-fruit, taro, plantains, and salt; which last article renders these islands superior to Otaheite, or any of the beautiful islands in the Southern Pacific Ocean, none of them producing any of this very useful article. Hogs and dogs are the only quadrupeds we saw here. The dog? appear to be of the cur kind, dull and heavy; they have sharp pointed ears projecting towards the nose* Birds are not in any great variety here: the humming-bird already mentioned, are by far the most numerous, and of which there are two species; viz. the red-bird before described, and another, the breast of a pale green, the back and wings of a light brown. There are also ducks, terns, owls, &c. Great numbers of the tropic bird and man of war bird breed at Tahoura, (which is uninhabited) and are frequenly caught there by the natives.

What number of inhabitants these islands contain, is impossible for me to fay with any degree of certainty. Captain King computes them at four hundred thousand, but, with all deference to such respectable authority, I cannot help thinking this account greatly exaggerated, and indeed this is pretty evident from similar passages in the fame voyage. Captain Cook, when at Atoui in the beginning of the voyage, estimates that island to contain thirty thousand inhabitants, and this from a supposition that there are sixty villages on the island, each containing five hundred people. This calculation is certainly in the extreme, but Captain King makes it still greater, and concludes Atoui to contain fifty-four thousand inhabitants, which is surely too many by at least one half. If therefore we deduct from the remainder of his calculations in the fame proportion, and reckon the whole number of inhabitants at two hundred thousand, I am persuaded - it will be much nearer the truth than Captain King's calculation, which seems to be founded on opinion merely speculative, rather than the result of close observation. These people in their temper and disposition are harmless, inoffensive, and friendly ; not subject to passion, or easily provoked ; In their manners they are lively and chearful, ever ready to render any little service in their power even to strangers, and pursue every thing they undertake with unremitting diligence and ap- L 1 2 plication."}, {"page_label": "Seite 328", "page_text": "268 A-VOYAGE TO THE 1787.

In opposition to these good qualities, it must be confessed that they are guilty of theft, and will not scruple to plunder whenever they have an opportunity > but this is most frequently practised by the Towtows ; and from the imperfect knowledge we have of their customs, it is impossible to fay how far theft is reckoned a crime. Yet with all this propensity to thieving, we never met with an instance of dishonesty whenever any thing was committed to their, charge, however valuable it might be to them. Their language is soft, smooth, and abounds with vowels. In their conversation with each other it appears very copious, and they speak with great volubility; but when conversing with us, they only make use of those words which are most expressive and significant, purposely omitting the many articles and conjunctions made use of when speaking to each other.

In writing these words, I have spelt them as near the pronunciation as I possibly could; and yet it is probable many of them might strike the ear of another person very differently. The same may be said in regard to the names of their Chiefs. I shall just observe, that where the accent falls on the letter it is generally pronounced broad. These people in general are about the middle size, rather slender, their limbs straight and well proportioned. Some of the Arees are inclined to corpulency, particularly the Aree women, and their skin is smoother and softer than those of the common rank, but this is owing to want of exercise, and an unlimited indulgence in the article of food, They are in general of a nut colour, though some of the women are fairer, and their hands and fingers are remarkably small and delicate. Both sexes go naked, except about the waist. The men wear a marrow piece of cloth, called a marow , barely sufficient to cover the adjacent parts : the ahou, or women's dress, is much larger, and generally reaches from the waist to the middle of the thigh.

Sometimes, by way of ornament, they wear a wreath of flowers fancifully disposed about the head; instead of a bracelet,, a shell is tied round the wrist, and a fondness for this ornament has rendered buttons so much esteemed by these gay damsels in general ; the neck, too, is adorned with various forts of shells, fastened on strings, after the manner of a necklace. But the most beautiful ornament wore by the women is a necklace or araia, made from the variegated feathers of the humming-bird, which are fixed on strings so regular and even, as to have a iurface equally smooth as velvet; and the rich colours of the feathers gives it an appearance equally rich and elegant., The caps and cloaks wore by the men are still superior in beauty and elegance. The cloaks are in general about the size of those, wore by the Spaniards ; the ground is net-work, and the feathers are sewed on in alternate squares, or triangular forms of red and yellow, which have a most brilliant appearance. The ground of the caps is wicker-work, in the form of a helmet; the elevated part from the forehead to the hind part of the neck, is about a hand's breadth, and generally covered with yellow feathers, the sides of the cap with red. This cap, together with the cloak, has an appearance equally splendid, if not superior to any scanet and gold whatever.

Nor are these caps and cloaks, though confessedly elegant in a superior degree, the only proofs of invention and ingenuity shewn by these people in matters of ornament. Their mats are made with a degree of neatness equal to any of European manufacture, and prettily diversified with a variety of figures stained with red. Those used to steep on are plain, and of a coarser kind, but made * with an equal degree of neatness and regularity. Cloth is another article which gives these Indians equal scope for fancy and invention. It is made from the Chinese paper mul- berry-tree, and when wet, (being of a soft, malleable substance) is beat out with small square pieces of wood, to from twelve to eighteen inches wide, and afterwards stamped with various colours and a diversity of patterns, the neatness and elegance of which would not disgrace the window of a London linen-draper. How this cloth is stamped I never could learn ; the different colours are extracted from vegetables found in the woods. There is another kind of cloth much finer than the above, and beat out to a greater extent: it is of a white colour, and frequently wore by the Aree women, in addition to the ahou. Fans and fly-staps are used by both sexes. The fans are usually made of the cocoa-nut fibres, neatly wove x the mounting is of a square form, and the handle frequently decorated with hair. The fly-staps are very curious; the handles are decorated with alternate pieces of wood and bone, which at a distance"}, {"page_label": "Seite 333", "page_text": "NORTH-WEST COAST OF AMERICA. distance has the appearance of finiered work; the upper part or flap is the feathers of the man of war bird. Fish-hooks are made of the pearl oyster-shell, and so contrived as to serve for both hook and bait. Those intended for sharks are considerably larger, and made of wood. Besides the variety of fishing-lines already mentioned, they have various other kinds of cordage, and made of different materials. The worst forts were found useful in rounding our cables ; that of a better kind was appropriated to other purposes j and the fishing-lines made excellent tackle-falls, top-gallant haul- yards, &c. I have already taken notice of the baskets we saw at Owhyhee: at the fame place we saw some square pillows, made nearly of the fame materials as the mats, and which I am informed resemble those used in China. Nets are made here with great ingenuity, and very large. I cannot inform thee what use they make of them, but they certainly are not altogether for ornament. The form of their gourds or calabashes is so very various, that they certainly make use of art to give them different shapes. Some are of a globular form, with a long narrow neck, like a bottle; others are tall and circular, but of equal width from top to bottom.

Their houses greatly resemble an hay-stack in shape, and are neatly thatched with stags, or rustles'; the door place is so very low that you are almost obliged to enter on all fours. They have no better contrivance for a door than a few temporary boards. The inside of their dwellings are kept neat and clean ; a coarse mat is spread on the floor; and as they have no separate apartments, that part of the room appropriated for repose is rather elevated, and, covered with mats of a finer fort. The houfhold utensils are placed on a wooden bench, and consist of gourds, and wooden bowls and dishes, which in general constitute the whole of their furniture. Those who are possessed of hogs or fowls, keep them in small out-houses appropriated for that purpose. The method universally practised to dress their victuals is baking, which is done in the following maner: a hole is dug in the ground sufficiently deep to answer the purpose of an oven, at the bottom of which a number of hot stones are laid ; these being covered with leaves, whatever they want dressed is laid on them ; more leaves are now laid on, and another layer of hot stones being added, the oven is covered. If a hog is baked, the belly is always filled with hot stones. Custom has rendered this mode of dressing victuals so very familiar, that they can tell the exact time when any thing is sufficiently done; and I must own that in baking taro or yams, they far excelled our people: they also dress the young tops of taro so as to be an excellent substitute for greens, though we never could boil them so as to eat palatabl) The"}, {"page_label": "Seite 335", "page_text": "NORTH-WEST COAST OF AMERICA. 275 The better sorts of food, such as hogs and fowls, are confined 1787. entirely to the Arees ; but baked dog is reckoned a peculiar de- ? £ P tomhet ; licacy. The Towtows, and the women in general, live on fish and vegetables. A kind of pudding made of taro constitutes a principal part of their food. The fish most esteemed is dolphin, and they have an excellent method of curing them, so as to keep good for any length of time. Why the women should be tabooed front flestt I never could learn; but it cannot surely proceed from scarcity ; and the Aree women are sometimes indulged with it. The knives used in killing and dressing hogs are made of shark's teeth, and so contrived as to be used in this business with equal dexterity and dispatch. The canoes are not only finished with neatness and ingenuity, , but, at the fame time are lasting proofs of perseverance and industry. They are made of a single tree, and are from twelve feet to forty or fifty feet long. The hollowing these trees, and bringing each end to a proper point with their rude unfashioned tools, must be a work of time and unremitting attention : they are in general about an inch thick, and heightened with additional boards neatly fitted round the sides. The single canoes are steadied by an outrigger, and the double ones are held together by semi-circular poles, firmly lashed to each part of the canoe; over these, and * parallel with the canoe, is a kind of platform, which serves to carry hogs, vegetables, or any thing they want to convey from one place to another, and at the same time is a convenient seat for the principal persons of both sexes, whilst the Towtows, who Mm 2 paddle,"}, {"page_label": "Seite 336", "page_text": "2-7 6 1787.

These people are very dexterous in catching fisli, two instances of which I had an opportunity of seeing. One day, when a number of Indians were along-side the vessel, one of our people, who was/ fishing with a small hook and line, had his bait taken by a large fish; being unwilling to lose his line (which being a Sandwich Island one, was regarded as a curiosity) he veered it away, but was afraid to haul it again; on this an Indian requested to have the management of it, which being granted, he played the fish with ease, and in a short time got it safe into his canoe. It proved to be a large cavallie, and weighed one hundred pounds. Another time, a large shark laid hold of a small line, which was immediately given to an Indian who happened to be along-side ; he played the shark for at least two miles, without hurting the line, and he only got away at last by drawing the hook straight as wire.. Another species of ingenuity met with amongst these people is- carving : they have a number of wooden images representing human figures, which they esteem as their gods; but I greatly doubt whether religion is held in any great estimation amongst them, for I could purchase every god amongst the islands for a few. toes. Sometimes their- ava dishes are supported by three of these, little wooden images, and this I reckon a master-piece in their carving, The bowls and dislies are made of a kind of wood resembling ebony, and are finished with a proportion and polish, equal, if not superior, to any thing made by our turners:.

I am inclined to think that most of their disorders proceed from an immoderate use of ava; it weakens the eyes, covers the body with a kind of leprosy, debilitates and emaciates the whole frame, makes the body paralytic, hastens old age, and no doubt bringsr on death itself,. The taboo I have before taken notice of: this is generally laid on by the priests, and sometimes by a person appointed particularly for that purpose, who is called sonata (or the taboo) man. When any particular spot of ground is tabooed, the wands used in marking the bounds resemble our gun-rods, and are tipped with a tuft of dog's hair. The heevas, or songs, cannot be described by notes, as they rather resemble a quick energetic mannner of speaking, than singing; and the performers seem to pay more attention to the motions of the body than the modulations of the voice. The women are - the most frequent performers in this kind of merriment; they begin their performance flow and regular, but by degrees it grows brisker and mo re. animated, 'till it terminates in convulsions of laughter.. It is very evident that these people have not the least idea of melody, as the tones and modulation in all their songs are invariably the fame; however, there seems to she some degree of invention (I had almost said poetry) in the composition of the words, which are often on temporary subjects; and. the frequent peals"}, {"page_label": "Seite 338", "page_text": "2/8 A VOYAGE TO THE 1787. peals of laughter are no doubt excited by some witty allusion or Sei-temhir . ot p er contained in them. The warlike implements in use among these people are spears, Tings, and bows and arrows. The spears are made os a kind of mahogany, about six feet long; one end is barbed, the other tapered nearly to a point: they throw them at each other, and those that are expert oft-times wound their adversary at a considerable distance. The slings too are used with equal dexterity and effect. The bows and arrows are made of reeds, and so slender, that I cannot think they are of any great use, however, as I had no opportunity of seeing their engagements, I can fay little on that head; what information I got being collected from the imperfect accounts of the natives.

I have frequently seen Indians jump out of 1787. their canoes and snatch hogs entrails, which have been thrown September , overboard by our people, at the very moment when a shark has been endeavouring to seize them. That these people have some idea of a Supreme Being , or rather of a multiplicity of beings, superior to themselves, there is not the least doubt. The business of their priests is chiefly to superintend and regulate the worship to their gods; to direct the ceremonies at their funerals, and probably to repeat orations or prayers upon these occasions : but the very short time any of us were on shore, gave us no opportunities of seeing these ceremonies performed, and therefore I shall not'attempt to describe them; as any account I could give would be equally partial and uncertain. I have before mentioned the circumstance of a human sacrifice being offered ; and we are perfectly assured this horrid custom still exists among these people, though their dispositions are kind, friendly, and humane, and they undoubtedly approach many degrees nearer to civilization than the poor wretches we met with on the inhospitable coast of America. On this head I shall make no remarks, but leave thee to draw thy own conclusions; and shall- (by way of closing my account) lay open a still larger field for speculative enquiry. Capt. Cook, in his last voyage to the Pacific Ocean, has shewn,, from that most indubitable of all proofs, affinity of language, that the Sandwich Islanders are descended from the Malayans, and are the fame race of people as those who inhabit New Zealand, the New Hebrides, the Marquesas, &c. which extend from 20 deg.

Towards afternoon the wind blew, very fresh from North North East and North East, and in the evening increased to a gale, on which we let go the best bower. During the night, and former part of the ioth, the wind continued to blow very fresh from the same quarter, which caused the vessel to pitch very much, but growing moderate towards the afternoon, we took up the best bower. At ten o'clock in the evening a Chinese boat came along-side, bringing a Mr. Folger on board; he was Chief Mate of the vessel we had seen in the Roads, and which proved to be the Imperial Eagle, Captain Berkley, who, thou mayest remember, was seen by Captain Colinett in King George's Sound. In consequence of a quarrel with Captain Berkley, he had left him and been at Macao, where, meeting with Captain Dixon, he had procured a passage with us to Canton. We learnt from Mr. Folger, that the Imperial Eagle left Ostend the 23d of November, 1786, and that King George's Sound was the farthest they had been to the Northward on the coast. They procured a good many valuable skins a degree or two to the Southward of King George's Sound; and their cargo consisted of nearly seven hundred prime skins, and many of inferior value. In the course of their trade they met with a most melancholy accident.

Canton is about fourteen miles higher up the river, but the ships of the different countries who trade to China are not admitted farther than Wampo. Indeed I believe the river is not navigable for large vessels so far as Canton. As It was Captain Dixon's wish to procure fresh provisions for the ship's company as soon as possible, no time was lost in making every necessary enquiry for that purpose, and we soon learnt, that in spite of our utmost care it would be impossible to avoid a number of impositions : that every vessel was supplied with whatever provisions they wanted by an officer, called a Comprador , who always demanded a cumjhau, or gratuity of three hundred- dollars, exclusive of the prosit which would accrue to him from.. serving us with provisions.. A demand of this nature appeared so very exorbitant, that we: determined, if possible, to avoid it; and a Captain Talker, from Bombay, whose vessel lay near ours, kindly offered to. furnish us with beef for the. present.

In the forenoon of the 17th the Captain returned from Canton. He was informed by the Company's Supercargoes that no steps could be taken respecting the disposal of our furs, till the Super- intendant of the Chinese Customs had been on board to measure our vestel; and as the King George was expected soon, he would not come till after her arrival. The Hoppo , as he is generally called, is a person of very great authority, and next in rank to the Viceroy of Canton. Having procured some beef from Captain Talker, the ship's Company were allowed two pounds per man, each day, with a proportionate quantity of greens, the man in the hoppo boat undertaking to supply us with every thing of the vegetable kind we might want.

After leaving Prince William's Sound,' Captain Portlock had fallen in with a harbour betwixt Cross Sound and the Bay of Elands,.

At the time of his being taken ill (which was on the 28th) he was on a visit on board the Locko Indiaman; and his drinking some stale porter after dinner brought on so violent a relapse of his disorder, as was supposed to be the immediate cause of his death. He died universally lamented by his friends and acquaintance, and was interred, in the forenoon of the 30th, on Frenchman's Istand. At ten o'clock in the morning of the ad of December we were honoured with the presence of John Tuck on board. He was attended by a numerous retinue, who paid him a princely respect:, saluting him at his coming upon deck with a bent knee. This visit seems to be a mere matter of form, as they only measure from the foremast to the taffrel, and then athwart near the gangway, which certainly can give them but a very imperfect idea of a vessel's burthen : however they demand (I am informed) no less than a thousand pounds sterling, as a port charge, for this piece of mummery. His Excellency made us a present of two poor buffaloes, eight jars of famfhu, (a spirit so bad that we threw it overboard) and eight bags of ground rice, about forty pounds each. This necessary piece of business being over, proper measures were taken to get our furs to Canton.

We sent to Canton twenty-three puncheons, two chests, and two casks, containing the whole of our furs; and seven puncheons, three chests, and one bundle, belonging to the King George; the particular contents of all which, I shall, perhaps, have occasion to mention hereafter. From our first arrival 'till now, the people had been employed in overhauling the rigging and repairing whatever was defective; our main yard had been condemned, and another substituted in its room, with sundry other necessary jobs. On the 6th we began to clear the hold, and sent our empty casks on shore to be repaired : the sail-makers were employed in making sundry new fails, and repairing the old ones. These different employments engrossed the greatest part of this month; and indeed we were in no particular hurry, as none of our furs were yet disposed of, and till then we could not take in any cargo for the East-India Company.

For some days past our supply of beef from the Royal Admiral had been by no means regular, and we had been obliged to use salt provisions more than once; this occasioned us to apply to Captain Portlock, (who had engaged a Comprador on his first arrival in the river) and on the 31st we began to receive our beef from the King George. By this time our after-hold was clear, and the castes on the ground tier ready for water; on this the long-boat was sent to Canton, that being the nearest place where water can be procured fit for use. Whilst every thing on board our vessel was getting forward with the utmost dispatch, in order to be ready for a cargo whenever the Council of Supercargoes should think proper to send one, our business at Canton was totally at a stand, none of our furs being as yet disposed of. In order to form some idea of the probable reasons for this delay, it perhaps may be necessary to fay a few words respecting the consignment of our steins, the methods taken by the persons they were consigned to for the disposal of them, and the various impediments raised by the Chinese to prevent their being sold to advantage. At the time our voyage was first set on foot, China was the market fixed on for the disposal of whatever furs we might procure ; and at the same time it was judged of no small consequence to"}, {"page_label": "Seite 360", "page_text": "3oo A VOYAGE TO THE to procure a freight from thence. An agreement with the Easiv India Company was accordingly made; our furs were to be fold to their Supercargoes at a fair price, or left in their hands for them to dispose of at a future opportunity, and they were to have a certain per centage on whatever sum of money they might fetch. No sooner were the thins landed at our factory, than a particu-- lar account of them was taken by a set of Merchants belonging to the Customs, and who (I understand) give security to the Emperor for the duty being paid : another account was taken by people, employed by Mr. Browne for that purpose.

In regard to the sale of our furs, I should firsts observe, that there is at Canton a Company of wealthy Merchants, called the I Iong-Merchants, with whom our East India Company transact all their business, and purchase from them the whole of the tea* and China-ware sent to Great Britain.

With these people the Hong-Merchants have great influence; so that had any indifferent person been at liberty to purchase our skins, and disposed to give us an advantageous price for them, the fear of having an enormous duty to pay, would at once deter him from any attempt of the kind; this we found strictly verified more than once. In this poor situation were we with respect to the sale of our cargo, during the month of December, and the greatest part of January: either we must close with the paltry offers which the Hong-Merchants had made to the Supercargoes, or be under the necessity of leaving our furs in their hands undisposed ofthis both parties knew we wished to avoid, if possible,.

It should seem, that our Captains had only a mere negative in this business - but finding it impossible to obtain a better price, and it being high time to think of failing, they were glad to close with this offer, though very far short of what we at one time had reason to expect: indeed there now were other reasons, and those very weighty ones, besides what I have already mentioned, for concluding this business.

These circumstances being duly considered, it certainly was the most prudent step our Captains could possibly take to close with the Supercargoes, as (exclusive of other considerations) by this means we were enabled to remit bills of exchange to our Owners, and our departure was greatly facilitated.

I have before observed, that there were sundry parcels of inferior furs, together with the marmot cloaks, which we were permitted to fell; a few of these had been disposed of, but the greatest part still lay on our hands, and they being the only thing which now detained us at China, we at last fold the whole, together with the stints, buckles, and blankets, to Chichinqua, for 1,000 dollars j the old man at the same time observing, that he had no other motive for making this purchase, than a wish to hasten our departure, it being a pity, he said, that two such small vessels as our's should be detained at a heavy expence for such a trifle.

Numerous villages are seen in these different vistos, and they abound with a pleasing variety of beautiful landscapes, agreeably ■diversified with plains, and gently rising grounds: the summits of the hills are adorned with lofty Pagodas ; the rising grounds are ornamented with trees of various forts, whose verdure is in constant succession, and resembles an everlasting spring, whilst the plains afford large quantities of sugar-cane and rice. Yet with all these combined advantages of nature and art, these prospects, so truly pleasing at a distance, lose much of their effect on a nearer approach. The soil is generally of a loose sandy nature, and the surface of the earth is far from possessing that beautiful verdure for which the British plains are so remarkable, and seems but ill adapted either for pasturage, or the cultivation of grain in general. The villages, though numerous, and extremely populous, are with some few exceptions, oppresied with poverty and want; and I believe the quantity of rice produced here, is quite- insufficient for the consumption of the inhabitants, great quantities being yearly imported from Manilla, and the East Indies. The climate at Wampo is extremely unhealthful, and such great and sudden variations are there in the temperature of the air, that I have frequently known the thermometer to change from 41 deg. to 86 deg. in twenty-four hours.

Here you fee English, French, Dutch, Danes, Swedes, Italians, and Prussians: the Americans, too, have, it seems, overcome their distaste against tea, and have opened a trade for that commodity with the Chinese. Till these few years the Germans had a factory at Canton, but at present the Imperial Company is insolvent, and they dare not send any vessels to China, for fear'of having them seized in part of payment for the debt already incurred. I greatly question, whether the trade carried on by our East India Company to China, is not of more consequence, than that of all other nations put together, if indeed we except that carried on by the Chinese Merchants to Manilla and Batavia, which is very extensive. The Captains of ships, during their stay here, hire temporary warehouses of the Chinese, situated near the river side, for the purpose of landing their stores or cargo, whilst their vessels are repairing, or carrying on any employment that can be done more conveniently here than on board : in this respect, the French have greatly the advantage over us, for their warehouses are situated on a dry comfortable isiand, where they have not only every convenience for carrying on their respective employments, but have likewise a comfortable hospital for the reception of their sick; whereas the English warehouses, being chiefly on the low marshy ground before-mentioned, are in some measure precluded from these advantages.

None of these Factors are allowed to stay at Canton after the ships leave the country, but: always go in the last vessel to Macao, where they reside till the shipping returns next season.

Without taking 1788. notice of such absurd disproportions, I shall just: observe, that f ebi y ary ; the calculation made by Captain King, is, in my humble opinion, by far nearest to the truth: he computes the number of inhabitants to be one hundred and. fifty thousand, which is certainly a very moderate calculation. Besides these, there are an amazing number of people who- live altogether on the water, in boats, called sampans, and amount, according to the lowest calculation, to forty thousand but I am inclined to think they considerably exceed that number. The greater part of these poor wretches obtain a precarious livelihood by fishing, and perhaps some trivial employments occasionally picked up on the river. Others again ply as constant passage-boats from place to place, after the manner of our watermen : for two dollars you may hire a handsome sampan, with good accommodations for eight or ten people, to take you from Wampo to Canton. These boats are fitted up in the inside almost like a parlour, with a table and chairs for the passengers. They have lattices made of pearl, and covered with a neat arched*, roof of bamboo.

The Chinese method of wearing their hair is something singular, though I believe the same custom prevails all over the East. They'shave the head close, except a small circular place on the crown ; this being frequently thaved when they are mere infants, the hair afterwards grows remarkably long, and is wore in a neat triple plait.

They are particularly careful to prevent foreigners from having any connection with their women; and whenever any thing of the kind is discovered, the party is sure to suffer imprisonment, or pay a heavy fine.

The Spaniards within these two years have imported the lea-otter to China : they collect their skins near their settlements of Mon- trery and San Francisco, and they are all of a very inferior quality. The Padres are the principal conductors of this traffic. In 1787 they imported about 200 skins, and the beginning of this year near 1,500. These furs were not fold when we left Canton ; they are sent from the settlements before-mentioned to Aca- pulco, and from thence by the annual galleon to Manilla; but they have not as yet attempted to fit out vessels from any of their settlements to the Northward. The L'Astrolabe and Boussale, two French ships, commanded by M. Peyrouse, and De Dangle, failed from France in 1785; they are said to have traced the North West Coast of America from the Spanish settlement of Montrery, to 60 deg.

These ships arrived at Macao in January, 1787, and their furs were fold at Canton by the Swedish Supercargoes, for 10,000 dollars. I have already furnished thee with most of the particulars re-' fpecting the sale of our furs, and mentioned the places where we collected them ; it only remains for me to observe, that the total amount was 54,857 dollars. By comparing the sale of our furs with those already mentioned, thou mayest at once perceive how very fluctuating this article is in the China market: out of 2,552 sea-otter skins, which we brought to Canton, at least 2,000 of them ought to have fetched fifty dollars each, and the remainder a price in proportion. What furs the Ruffians procure on the American coast, it is impossible to ascertain, as they never bring them to the Canton market. We are pretty certain, that their traffic extends very little to the Eastward of Cook's River, and that place certainly does not produce so many fea-otter as King George's Sound ; so that I should imagine they do not collect 500 skins annually. From this short sketch of the fur-trade, thou mayest easily perceive, that very great advantages would be derived from it, if placed on a permanent footing, to effect which, I should conceive the most eligible plan would be, to establish a factory on the coast, and the North end of Queen Charlotte's Islands seems peculiarly well adapted for that purpose; the situation is nearly central, between S s Cook's 1788.

It is totally covered with trees of various forts, many of which I believe are found in our West India islands.

O UR passage during the month of March has been the most tedious, and by far the most unhealthy of any we have experienced during the voyage, and particularly in passing the Straights of Banca. The land, both on the Banca and Sumatra coast, is low, flat and marshy; and as we in general had light winds, the weather was extremely hot and sultry. A faint sickly heat seized the greatest part of our people, indeed the strongest on board felt its influence more or less: we luckily had a good quantity of Peruvian bark on board, which was regularly given to all the sickly people, and its good effects were soon perceptible; we also had the good fortune not to have the least appearance of the scurvy amongst us. Captain Portlock had lost two of his people with the flux since our leaving China, and several more were in a sickly state; however, our getting out to sea raised every one's spirits.

She proved to be the Lansdowne, Captain Storey, who, as has been already mentioned, got a-ground in the Straights of Banca, but got clear of the Straights of Sunda a week before us. As this vessel is esteemed a prime sailer, it cannot be denied but that the sight of her at this time infused fresh spirits into every person on board, especially when we compared our bad sailing vessel to her, and found that with all her boasted superiority, and the time she had before gained on us, we were yet on a par in regard to the voyage. This incident brought that observation of Solomon fresti into my memory, \" The race is not to the swift,\" &c. for we here had an incontestible proof, that \" time and chance happeneth to all.\" Captain Storey informed us, that he had been beating about the Cape ever since the 15th, which was the same time we met with the gale, but did not assign, any reason for his not getting here sooner. Our observation at noon gave 35 deg. 32 min. South latitude; and the mean of some lunar observations 337 deg. 48 min. West longitude.

For some days previous to this gale we had got scarcely any sand out of the well , and the pump was fixed in its place, but now, the motion of the vessel obliged us to take it up again, and we got up nearly as much sand as when this unlucky accident first happened. Our latitude at noon was 3 7 deg. n min. South, the weather squally, with rain, the wind still at North West. At eight o'clock in the evening, to our great joy, a fresh gale came on at South West, and during the night it blew very heavy, with frequent squalls, constant rain, and much lightning: we carried all the fail we could with prudence, being exceedingly anxious to double this Cape. During the whole of the 29th, the wind blew strong from the fame favourable quarter, and we steered North West, and North West by North, as best suited our purpose, there being about two points Westerly variation. The wind on the 30th, was equally favourable to us: in the forenoon of the 31st, the wind veered to South East, still blowing a fine steady breeze, with moderate weather; our latitude at noon was 33 deg. 44min.
