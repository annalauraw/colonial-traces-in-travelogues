We were at a considerable distance from the shore, and he was at a considerable distance from the ship, which was between him and the shore ; so that, it being a dead calm, I began to be in some pain for him, fearing that he might not see the canoes time enough to reach the ship before they should get up with him: soon after, however, we saw his boat in motion, and had the pleasure to take him on board before the Indians came up, who probably had not seen him, as their attention seemed to be wholly fixed upon the ship. They came within, about a stone's cast, and then stopped, gazing at us with a look of vacant astonishment: Tupia exerted all his eloquence to prevail upon them to come nearer, but without any effect. After surveying us for some time, they left us, and made towards the shore; but had not measured more than half the distance between that and the ship before it was dark. We imagined that these people had heard nothing of us, and could not but remark the different behaviour and dispositions of the inhabitants of the different parts of this coast upon their first approaching the vessel. These kept aloof with a mixture of timidity and wonder; others had immediately commenced hostilities, by pelting us with stones: the gentleman whom we had found alone, fishing in his boat, seemed to think us entirely unworthy of his notice; and some, almost without invitation, had come on board with an air of perfect confidence and good-will.

In this course we continued till six o'clock the next morning, when we had run eleven leagues, but saw no land, except that which we had left. Having stood to the 8.

When this island was first discovered in the direction of 8. by W. some persons on board were of opinion that they also saw land bearing 8. 8. E. and 8. E. by E. I was myself upon the deck at the time, and told them, that in my opinion it was no more than a cloud, and that as the fun rose it would dissipate and vanish. However, as I was determined to leave no subject for disputation which experiment could remove, I ordered the ship to be wore, and steered E. S.

By seven o'clock at night we had run eight and twenty miles, when seeing no land, nor any signs of any, but that which we had left, we bore away S. by W. and continued upon that course till the next day at noon, when we were in latitude 45 0 16', the south point of Banks's Island bearing N. 6° 30' W. distant twenty-eight leagues. The variation by the azimuth this morning was 15 9 30' E. As no signs of land had yet appeared to the southward, and as I thought that we had stood far enough in that direction to weather all the land we had left, judging from the report of the natives in Queen Charlotte's Sound, I hauled to the westward. We had a moderate breeze at N.N.W. and N. till eight in the evening, when it became unsettled; and at ten fixed at south: during the night, it blew with such violence that it brought us under our close reefed topsails. At eight the next morning, having run twenty-eight leagues upon a W. by N. 7 N. course, and judging ourselves to be to the westward of the land of Tovy Poenammoo, we bore away N. W. with a fresh gale at south. At ten, having run eleven miles upon this course, we saw land extending from the S. W. to the N. W. at the distance of about ten leagues, which we hauled up for.

W. by 8. to N. by W.; and at six leagues from the shore we had thirty-two fathom water. At four o'clock the next morning, we stood in for the shore W. by S. and during a course of four leagues, our depth of water was from thirty-two to thirteen fathom. When"}, {"page_label": "Seite 13", "page_text": "ROUND THE WORLD. When it was thirteen fathom we were but three miles distant from the shore, and therefore stood off; its direction is here nearly N. and 8.

It appeared to be totally barren, and we saw no signs of its being inhabited. Our latitude, at noon, was 44\" 44'; and the longitude which we made from Banks's Island to this place was 2 0 22' W. During the last twenty-four hours, though we carried as much fail as the Ihip would bear, we were driven three leagues to the leeward.

From one league to four leagues north of Cape Launders, the shore forms two or three bays, in which there appeared to be good anchorage, and effectual shelter from the S.W. westerly, and N. westerly winds ; but my desire of getting to the southward, in order to ascertain whether this country was an island or a continent, prevented my putting into any of them. We kept at a small distance from the shore all this morning, with the wind at 8. W. and had a very distinct view of it: it is of a moderate height, and the surface is broken by many hills which are green and woody ; but we saw no appearance of inhabitants.

E. but it being hazy, we could distinguish nothing upon it. At noon, our latitude, by observation, was 46° 8. About two it cleared up, and the land appeared to be high, rude, and mountainous: about half an hour after three I hauled in for a bay, in which there appeared to be good anchorage; but in about an hour, finding the distance too great to run before it would be dark, and the wind blowing too hard to make the attempt safe in the night, I bore away along the fihore. This bay, which I called Dusky Bay, lies in latitude 45 0 47' 8: it is between three and four miles broad at the entrance, and seems to be full as deep as it is broad: it contains several islands, behind which there must be shelter from all winds, though possibly there may not be sufficient depth of water. The north point of this bay, when it bears 8. E. by 8. is rendered very remarkable by five high peaked rocks which lie off it, and have the appearance of the four fingers and thumb of a man's hand, for which reason I called it Point Five Fingers : the land of this Point is farther remarkable, for being the only level land within a considerable distance. It extends near two leagues to the northward, is lofty, and covered with wood: the land behind it is very different, consisting wholly of mountains, totally barren and rocky; and this difference gives the Cape the appearance of an island.

Tuesday ' 3 * It lies about three leagues to the southward of Dusky Bay, in the latitude of 4 5 0 54' S. and in the longitude of 193° 1/ W. The land of this Cape is of a moderate height next the sea, and has nothing remarkable about it, except a very white cliff, two or three leagues to the southward of it : to the southward of it also the land trends away to the S.

At this time, being about a league and an half from the shore, we sounded, but had no ground with seventy fathom: we had just passed a small narrow opening in land, where there seemed to be a very safe and convenient harbour, formed by an island, which lay in the middle of the opening at east. The opening lies in latitude 45 0 16'S. and on the land behind it are mountains, the summits of which were covered with snow, that appeared to have been recently fallen; and indeed for two days past we had found the weather very cold. On each side the entrance of the opening, the land rises almost perpendicularly from the sea to a stupendous height, and this indeed was the reason why I did not carry the ship into it, for no wind could blow there but right in, or right out, in the direction of either east or west, and I thought it by no means advisable to put into a place whence I could not have got out but with a wind which experience had taught me did not blow more than one day in a month. In this, however, I acted contrary to the opinion of some persons on board, who in very strong"}, {"page_label": "Seite 22", "page_text": "-22 LIEUTENANT COOK's VOYAGE ^1770. strong terms expressed their desire to harbour for present con- ----' venience, without any regard to future disadvantages. Wednes. 14. In the evening, being about two leagues from the shore, we sounded, and had no ground with 108 fathom: the variation of the needle, by azimuth, was 14° E. and by amplitude 15° 2'. We made the best of our way along the shore with what wind we had, keeping at the distance of between two and three leagues. At noon, we were in latitude 44° 4/, having run only twelve leagues upon a N. E. -s N. course, during the last four and twenty hours. We eontinued to steer along the stiore, in the direction of N. E. ± E. till six o'clock in the evening, when we brought to Thursday 15. for the pight. At four in the morning, we stood in for the land, and when the day broke we saw what appeared to be an inlet; but upon a nearer approach proved to be only a deep valley between two high lands: we proceeded therefore in the fame course, keeping the shore at the distance of Friday 16. between four and five miles. At noon on the 16th, the northermost point of land in sight bore N. 60 E. at the distance of ten miles ; and our latitude, by observation, was 44 0 5', our longitude from Cape West 2 0 8' E. About two, we past the point which at noon had been distant ten miles, and found it to consist of high red cliffs, down which there fell a cascade of water in four small streams, and I therefore gave it the name of Cascade Point. From this Point the land trends first N. 76 E. and afterwards more to the northward. At the distance of eight leagues from Cascade Point, in the direction of E.

This point I called Fnday z3 ' Rock's Point. Our latitude was now 40° $5 S. and having nearly run down the whole of the north west coast of Tovy Poenammoo, I shall give some account of the face of the country. I have already observed, that on the 1 ith, when we were off the lbuthern part, the land then seen was craggy and mountainous, and there is great reason to believe that the same ridge of mountains extends nearly the whole length of the island. Between the westermost land which we saw that day, and the eastermost which we saw on the 13th, there is a space of about six or eight leagues, of which we did not fee the coast, though we plainly discovered the mountains inland. The sea coast near Cape West is low, rising with an easy and gradual ascent to the foot of the mountains, and being in most parts covered with wood. From Point Five Fingers, down to latitude 44 0 20', there is a narrow ridge of hills that rises directly from the sea, and is covered with. wood: close behind these hills are the mountains, extending in another ridge of a stupendous height, and consisting of rocks that are totally barren and naked, except where they are covered with snow, which is to be seen in large patches upon many parts of them, and has probably lain there ever since the creation of the world: a prospect more rude, craggy, and desolate than this country affords from the sea, cannot possibly be conceived, for as far inland as the eye can reach, nothing appears but the summits of rocks, which stand so near together, that instead of vallies there are only fissures between them.

From latitude 42 0 8', to 41 0 30', the land is not distinguished by any thing remarkable: it rises into hills directly from the sea, and is covered with wood; but the weather being foggy while we were upon this part of the coast, we could fee very little inland, except now and then the summits of the mountains, towering above the cloudy mists that obscured them below, which confirmed my opinion that a chain of mountains extended from one end of the island to the other. In the afternoon, we had a gentle breeze at S. W. which, before it was quite dark, brought us abreast of the eastern point which we had seen at noon; but not knowing what course the land took on the other side of it, we brought to in thirty-four fathom, at the distance of about one league from the shore.

When the day broke we saw land bearing 8.

As we had now circumnavigated the whole country, it became necessary to think of quitting it\" but as I had thirty tons of empty water calks on board, this could not be done till I had filled them: I therefore hauled round the island, and entered a bay, which lies between that and Queen Charlotte's Sound, leaving three more islands, which lay close under the western shore, between three or four miles within the entrance, on our starboard hand: while we were running in, we kept the lead continually going, and had from forty to twelve fathom. At six o'clock in the evening, we anchored in eleven fathom with a muddy bottom, under the west shore, in the second cove, that lies within the three islands j and as soon as it was light the next morning, I took a boat, and went on shore to look for a watering-place, and a proper birth for the sliip, both which I found, much to my satisfaction. As soon as the sliip was moored, I sent an officer on shore to superintend the watering, and the carpenter, with his crew, to cut wood, while the long-boat was employed in landing the empty castes.

After rowing about two leagues up it, I went ashore upon L point of land on the western side, and having climbed ar hill, I saw the western arm of this bay run in 8. W. by W. about five leagues farther, yet I could not discover the end of it: there appeared to be several other inlets, or at least small* bays, between this and the north west head of Queen Chai> forte's Sound, in each of which, I make no doubt, there is anchorage and shelter, as they are all covered from the sea wind by the islands' which lie without them. The land about this bay, as far as I could fee of it, is of a hilly surface, chiefly covered with trees, shrubs, and fern, which render travelling difficult and fatiguing. In this excursion I was accompanied by Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, who founjD several new plants. We met with some huts, which seemed to have been long deserted, but saw no inhabitants. Mr. Banks examined several of the stones that lay upon the beach, which were full of veins, and had a mineral appearance ; but he did not discover any thing in them which he knew to be ore: if he had had an opportunity to examine any of the bare rocks, perhaps he might have been more fortunate. He was also of opinion that what I had taken for marble in another place, was a mineral substance ; and that, considering the correspondence of latitude between this place and South America, it was not improbable but that, by a proper examination, something very valuable might be found.

I had 1770. myself a strong desire to return by Cape Horn, because that would have enabled me finally to determine, whether there Fr,da y 3 °* is or is not a southern continent; but against this it was a sufficient objection that we must have kept in a-high\"southern latitude in. the very depth of winter, with-a vessel which was not thought sufficient for the undertaking r and the same reason was urged against our proceeding directly for the Cape of Good Hope, with still more force, because no' discovery of moment could be hoped for in that rout; it was therefore resolved that we should return by the East Indies,, and that with this view we should, upon leaving the coast, steer westward, till we should fall in with the east coast of New Holland, and then follow the direction of that coast to the northward, till we should' arrive at its northern extremity ; but if that should be found impracticable, it was further resolved that we should endeavour to fall in with the land, or islands, said to have been discovered by Quiros. With this view, at break of day on Saturday the 31st of Saturday 31. March 1770, we got under fail, and put to sea, with the advantage of a fresh gale at 8.

On board this vessel embarked Joseph Banks Esquire, a Gentleman possessed of considerable landed property in ■Lincolnshire. He received the education of a scholar rather to qualify him for the enjoyments than the labours of life; yet an ardent desire to know more of Nature than could be learnt from books, determined him, at a very early age, to forego what are generally thought to be the principal advantages of a liberal fortune, and to apply his revenue not in procuring the pleasures of leisure and ease, but in the pursuit of his favourite study, through a series of fatigue and danger, which, in such circumstances,ssiave very seldom been voluntarily incurred, except to gratify the restless and insatiable desires of avarice or ambition.

The danger, difficulty, and inconvenience that attend long voyages are very different in idea and experience; Mr. Banks however returned, undifcouraged, from his first expedition; and when he found that the Endeavour was equipping for a voyage to the South Seas, in order to observe the Transit of Venus, and afterwards attempt farther discoveries, he determined to embark in the expedition, that he might enrich his native country with a tribute of knowlege from those which have been hitherto unknown, and not without hope of leaving among the rude and uncultivated nations that he might discover, something that would render life of more value, and enrich them perhaps in a certain degree with the knowlege, or at least with the productions, of Europe.- As he was determined to spare no expence in the execution of his plan, he engaged Dr. Solander to accompany him in the voyage. This Gentleman, by birth a Swede, was educated under the celebrated Linnaeus, from whom he brought letters of recommendation into England, and his merit, being soon known, he obtained an appointment in the British. Musaeum, a public institution which was then just established; such a companion Mr. Banks considered as an acquisition of no small importance, and to his great satisfaction the event abundantly proved that he was not mistaken.

This was an offer of which I gladly and thankfully accepted: I knew the advantage would be great, for few philosophers have furnished materials for accounts of voyages undertaken to discover new countries. The adventurers in such expeditions* have generally looked only upon the great outline of Nature, without attending to the variety of shades within,, which give life and beauty to the piece. The papers of Captain Cook contained a very particular account of all the nautical incidents of the voyage, and a very minute description of the figure and extent of the countries he had visited, with the bearings of the headlands and bays that diversify the coasts, the situation of the harbours in which shipping may obtain refreshments, with tire depth of water wherever there were soundings; the latitudes, longitudes, variation of the needle, and such* other particulars as lay in his department; and.abundantly shewed him to be an excellent officer, and- skilful navigator. But in the papers which were communicated to me by Mr. Banks, I found a great variety of incidents which had not come under the notice of Captain Cook,, with descriptions of countries and people, their productions, manners, customs, religion, policy, and language,- much more full and particular than were expected from a Gentleman whose station and office naturally turned his* principal attention to other objects; for these particulars,, therefore, besides many practical observations, the Public S-"}, {"page_label": "Seite XIV", "page_text": "Xiv INTRODUCTION. is indebted to Mr. Banks. To Mr. Banks also the Public is indebted for the designs of the engravings which illustrate and adorn the account of this voyage, all of them, except the maps, charts, and views of the coasts as they appear at sea, being copied from his valuable drawings, and some of them from such as were made for the use of the artists at his expence. As the materials furnished by Mr. Banks were so interesting and copious, there arose an objection against writing an account of this voyage in the person of the Commander, which could have no place with respect to the others ; the descriptions and observations of Mr. Banks would be absorbed without any distinction, in a general narrative given under another name : but this objection he generously over-ruled, and it therefore became necestary to give some account of the obligations which he has laid upon the \"Public and myself in this place.

Narborough is certainly a credible witness, and his evidence is directly to the point: it is confirmed by that of L'Hermite, who fays, that the people he saw upon the coast of Terra del En ego, though they were robust and well-proportioned , were not larger than the inhabitants of Europe; and lastly, M. de Gennes bears testimony that none of the people he saw at Port Famine were six feet high. \" Those who diligently consider these different relations will find reason to believe, that all the parties have spoken truth, each of them faithfully reporting what he saw, and therefore that the existence of a gigantic race in these parts is a real fact, not to be questioned merely because they were not seen by every mariner that visited the country. \" It appears to be well established, that the inhabitants of the two borders of the Streight are of the common stature ; and that the race distinguished by the name of Patagonians, made their constant residence upon the de fart coasts, either in some miserable hovels in the depth of the woods, or in some caverns of the rocks, scarcely accessible to any but themselves: and it appears from the account of Oliver de Noort, that when the Streight began to be frequented by European vessels, they hid themselves as soon as the ships were in sight, which accounts both for their not being seen, and for the recent marks of inhabitants upon a coast that appeared to be desart. Perhaps the frequent appearance of our strips upon this coast, at length determined them to quit it as a settled habitation, returning only at particular seasons of the year, and taking up their constant residence in the interior part of the country. Lord Anson was of opinion, that they resided statedly on the western side of the Cordeliers, c 2 and"}, {"page_label": "Seite XVI", "page_text": "xvi GENERAL INTRODUCTION. and visited the eastern side occasionally, but not often : so that if they have been rarely seen by the vessels which have touched at the coast of Patagonia for the last hundred years, the reason probably is, that being, like other Indian nations, desirous to conceal themselves from strangers, they retired to the mountains. It is indeed to be regretted, that no skeleton of these people has been brought into Europe ; and it may at first seem strange, that no such evidence of their uncommon stature should have been produced, as it is known that several of them who had been made prisoners by the Commanders of European vessels, died on board soon after they came into a hot climate ; but the wonder will cease, when it is considered that all mariners have a superstitious opinion that the compass will not traverse if there is a dead body on board the vessel.\" Upon the whole, it may reasonably be presumed, that the concurrent testimony of late navigators, particularly Commodore Byron, Captain Wallis, and Captain Carteret, Gentlemen of unquestionable veracity, who are still living, and who not only saw and conversed with these people, but measured them, will put an end to all the doubts that have been hitherto entertained of their existence. Having thus brought together the whole of the evidence for and against a fact which has long been the object both of popular and philosophical curiosity, I shall not anticipate any opinion that the Reader may form concerning future navigations in the track which has been described by any of the vessels whose voyages are here related, except that although it is the opinion of Commodore Byron, who spent seven weeks and two days in passing through the Streight of Magellan, that it may be passed in three weeks at the proper season ; yet the passage cost Captain Wallis near four months,"}, {"page_label": "Seite XVII", "page_text": "GENERAL INTRODUCTION. months, though he performed it precisely at the time re- commended by the Commodore, having reached the eastern, entrance about the middle of December. I cannot however dismiss my Readers to the following narratives, without expressing the regret with which I have recorded the destruction of poor naked savages, by our firearms, in the course of these expeditions, when they endeavoured to repress the invaders of their country ; a regret which I am confident my Readers will participate with me r this however appears to be an evil which, if discoveries of new countries are attempted, cannot be avoided: resistance will always be made, and if those who resist are not overpowered, the attempt must be relinquished. It may perhaps be said, that the expence of life upon these occasions is more than is necessary to convince the natives that further contest is hopeless, and perhaps this may sometimes have been true: but it must be considered, that if such expeditions are undertaken, the execution of them must be intrusted to persons not exempt from human frailty ; to men who are liable to* provocation by sudden injury, to unpremeditated violence by sudden danger, to error by the defect of judgment or the strength of paflion, and always disposed to transfer laws by which they are bound themselves, to others who are not subject to their obligation ; so that every excess thus produced is also an inevitable evil. If it should be said, that supposing these mischiefs to be inevitable in attempting discoveries, discoveries ought not to be attempted it must be considered, that upon the only principles on which this opinion can be supported* the risk of life, for advantages of the same kind with those proposed in discovering new countries, is in every other instance unlawful. If it is not lawful to put the life of an Indian in a hazard* xvii"}, {"page_label": "Seite XVIII", "page_text": "xviii GENERAL INTRODUCTION. hazard, by an attempt to examine the country in which he lives, with a view to increase commerce or knowlege; it is not lawful to risk the life of our own people in carrying on commerce with countries already known. If it be said that the risk of life in our own people is voluntary, and that the Indian is brought into danger without his consent, the consequence will still follow; for it is universally agreed, at least upon the principles of Christianity, that men have no more right over their own lives than over the lives of others, and suicide being deemed the worst species of murder, a man must be proportionably criminal in exposing his own life, for any purpose that would not justify his exposing the life of another. If the gratification of artificial wants, or the increase of knowlege, are justifiable causes for the risk of life, the landing by force on a newly discovered country, in order to examine its produce, may be justified; if not, every trade and profession that exposes life for advantages of the same kind is unlawful; and by what trade or profession is not life exposed ? Let us examine all the multitudes that art has employed, from the refiner who sweats at the furnace to the sedentary artificer who grows pale at the loom, and perhaps none can be found in which life is not in some degree sacrificed to the artificial necessities of civil society. But will it therefore be said, that civil society, to which this sacrifice is made, is for that reason a combination contrary to the great original principles of morality, which are the basis of all duty? Will it be said, that to exercise the faculties which are the distinguishing characteristics of our nature is unnatural ? and Mat being endowed with the various powers which in civil societies only can be brought into action, it was incongruous to the will of our Creator that any such society slubuld be formed, and that it would be pleasing to him if, still continuing in a. savage state, these powers ssiould lie 1"}, {"page_label": "Seite XIX", "page_text": "GENERAL INTRODUCTION. lie torpid in our nature, like life in an embrio, during the whole of our existence? This surely must appear extravagant and absurd in the highest degree, especially as it must be allowed, that although commerce and arts in some instances expose life, in others they preserve it-j they supply the wants os Nature, without rapine and violence, and by producing a common interest, they prevent the inhabitants of the fame country from being divided into different clans,, which among savages are almost perpetually-committing hostilities against each other, with a ferocious cruelty which is nc*' to be found where civil government and literary knowlege have meliorated the manners of mankind. Upon the whole,, therefore, it seems reasonable to conclude, that the increase of knowlege and commerce are ultimately common benefits ; and that the loss of life which happens in the attempt, is among the partial evils which terminate in general good. I have now only to request of such of my Readers as may be disposed to censure me for not having attributed any of the critical escapes from danger that I have recorded, to the particular interposition of Providence, that they would, in this particular, allow me the right of private judgment* which I claim with the greater confidence, as the very same principle which would have determined them to have done it, has determined me to the contrary. As I firmly believe the divine precept delivered by the Author of Christianity, \" there is not a sparrow falls to the ground without my father,\" and cannot admit the agency of chance in the government of the world, I must necessarily refer every event to one cause, as well the danger as the escape, as well the sufferings as the enjoyments of life: and for this opinion, I have, among other respectable authorities, that of the Bible. Shall we, says- Job, \" receive good from the hand of God and shall we not receive evil?\" The Supreme Being is equally wiseand benevolent"}, {"page_label": "Seite XX", "page_text": "GENERAL INTRODUCTION. in the dispensation of both evil and good, as means of effecting ultimate purposes worthy of his ineffable perfections; so that whether we consider ourselves as christians or philosophers, we must acknowledge that he deserves blessing not more when he gives than when he takes away. If the fall of a sparrow, as well as its preservation, is imputed to providence, why not the fall as well as the preservation of a man ? and why stsould we attribute to Providence only what appears to be good in its immediate effect, when we suppose that the whole concatenation of events, whether the preservation or destruction of particular parts, tends ultimately to the good of the whole ? The same voice commissions the winds to plough up the deep, which at the appointed time rebukes them, saying, \" Peace, be still.\" If the adorable Author and Preserver of Nature was such a being as Baal is represented to have been by the prophet, when he derided his worshippers; if he was sometimes on a journey, and sometimes asleep, we might with propriety fay that a fire happened to break out, or a storm to rife, but that by the interposition of providence life was preserved, expressions which imply that the mischief had one origin, and the remedy another; but such language certainly derogates from the honour of the great Universal Cause, who, acting through all duration, and subsisting in all space, sills immensity with his presence, and eternity with his power. It will perhaps be said, that in particular instances evil necessarily results from that constitution of things which is best upon the whole, and that Providence occasionally interferes, and supplies the defects of the constitution in these particulars : but this notion will appear not to be supported by those facts which are said to be providential; it will always be found that Providence interposes too late, and only moderates the mischief which it might have prevented. But who"}, {"page_label": "Seite XXI", "page_text": "GENERAL INTRODUCTION. xxi who can suppose an extraordinary interposition of Providence to supply particular defects in the constitution of nature, who fees those defects supplied but in part ? It is true that when the Endeavour was upon the rock off the coast of New Holland, the wind ceased, and that otherwise {he must have been beaten to pieces ; but either the subsiding of the wind was a mere natural event or not; if it was a natural event, providence is out of the question, at least we can with no more propriety fay that providentially the wind ceased, than that providentially the sun rose in the morning. If it was not a mere natural event, but produced by an extraordinary interposition, correcting a defect in the constitution of nature, tending to mischief, it will lie upon those who maintain the position, to Ihew, why an extraordinary interposition did not take place rather to prevent the ship's striking, than to prevent her being beaten to pieces after she had struck : a very slight impulse upon the Ihip's course would have caused her to steer clear of the rock, and if all things were not equally easy to Omnipotence, we should say that this might have been done with less difficulty than a calm could be produced by suspending the general laws of Nature which had brought on the gale. I have, however, paid my homage to the Supreme Being, consonant to my own ideas of his agency and perfections; and those who are of opinion that my notions are erroneous, must allow, that he who does what he thinks to be right, and abstains from what he thinks to be wrong, acquits himself equally of moral obligation, whether his opinions' are false or true.

Spring is also a rope passed out of one extremity of a ship and attached to a cable proceeding from the other, when she lies at anchor. It is usually done to bring the ship's broadside, or battery of cannon, to bear upon some distant object. SPRITSAIL, a fail attached to a yard which hangs under the bowsprit. SQUALL, a sudden and violent blast of wind, usually occasioned by the interruption and reverberation of the wind from high mountains.

STANDING, the movement by which a Ihip advances towards a* certain object, or departs from it. STARBOARD, the right side of a ssilp when the eye of the spectator is directed forward. To STAY, the lame as to tack; the contrary to wear, which fee; hence the phrase to miss stays when she fails in the operation. STIFF, the quality by which a ship is enabled to carry a sufficient quantity of sail, without hazard of oversetting. STREAKS, or STRAKES, the uniform ranges of planks on the bottom and sides of a strip. To STRIKE, to run ashore, or to beat upon the ground in passing over a bank or shallow. STUDDING-SAILS, certain light sails extended, in moderate and steady breezes, beyond the Ikirts of the principal fails, where they ap-' pear as wings upon the yard-arms. .e 2 SURF,"}, {"page_label": "Seite XXXII", "page_text": "xxxii AN EXPLANATION OF THE NAUTICAL TERMS. SURF, the swell of the sea which breaks upon the shore, or any rock lying near the surface of the water. SWEEPING, the act of dragging the bight, or loose part of a small rope, along the surface of the ground, in a harbour or road, in order to hook and recover some anchor, wreck, or other material, sunk at the bottom. It is performed by fastening the two ends of this rope to the sides of two boats which are abreast of each other, at some distance. To the middle of the rope are suspended two cannon shot, or something which weighs heavy, in order to sink it to the ground: so that, as the boats advance by rowing ahead, the rope drags along the bottbm, to hook any thing for which they are searching.

And indeed the forts themselves seem to be no farther serviceable than by enabling the possessors to repress a sudden attack; for as there is no supply of water within the lines,, it would be impossible to sustain a siege. A considerable stock of fern-root and dry-fish is indeed laid up in them; but they may be reserved against seasons of scarcity, and that such seasons there are, our observations left us no room to doubt; besides, while an enemy should be prowling in the neighbourhood, it would be easy to snatch a supply of water from the side of the hill, though it would be impossible to dig up fern root or catch fish. In this district, however, the people seemed to live in a state of conscious security, and to avail themselves of their advantage: their plantations were more numerous, their canoes were more decorated, and they had not only finer carving, but finer clothes. This part of the coast also was much the most populous, and possibly their apparent peace and plenty might arise from their being united under one Chief, or King; for the inhabitants of all this part of the country told us, that they were the subjects of Teratu : when they pointed to the residence of this Prince, it was in a direction which we thought inland; but which, when we knew the country better, we found to be the Bay of Plenty.

Possibly the fortified towns which we saw in the Bay of Plenty may be his barrier; especially as at Mercury Bay he was not acknowledged, nor indeed any other single Chief: for wherever we landed, or spoke with the people upon that coast, they told us that we were at but a small distance from their enemies. In the dominions of Teratu we saw several subordinate Chiefs, to whom great respect was paid, and by whom justice was probably administered \" for upon our complaint to one of them, of a theft that had been committed on board the ship by a man that came with him, he gave him several blows and kicks, which the other received as the chastisement of authority, against which no resistance was to be made, and which he had no right to resent. Whether this authority was possessed by appointment or inheritance we could not learn; but we observed that the Chiefs, as well here as in other parts, were elderly men. In other parts, however, we learnt that they possessed their authority by inheritance. The little societies which we found in the southern parts seemed to have several things in common, particularly their fine clothes and fishing nets. Their fine clothes, which possibly might be the spoils of war, were kept in a small hut, which was erected for that purpose in the middle of the town: the nets we saw making in almost every house, and the several parts being afterwards collected were joined together.

Of the religion of these people it cannot be supposed that we could learn much; they aknowledge the influence of superior beings, one of whom is supreme, and the rest subordinate ; and gave nearly the same account of the origin of the world, and the production of mankind, as our friends, in Otaheiter Tupia, however, seemed to have a much more deep and extensive knowlege of these subjects, than. any of the people here ; and whenever he was disposed to instruct them, which he sometimes did in a long discourse, he was sure of a numerous audience, who listened in profound silence, with such reverence and attention, that we could not but wish them a better teacher.

But whatever may be the sepulchre, the living are themselves the monuments; for we saw scarcely a single person of either sex whose body was not marked by the scars of wounds which they had inflicted upon themselves as a testimony of their regret for the loss of a relation or friend: some of these wounds we saw in a state so recent that the blood was scarcely staunched, which shows that death had been among them while we were upon the coast ; and makes it more extraordinary that no funeral ceremony should have fallen under our notice: some of the scars were very large and deep, and in many instances had greatly disfigured the face. One monument indeed we observed of another kind, the cross that was set up near Queen Charlotte's Sound.

Thus far our navigation has certainly been unfavourable to the notion of a southern continent, for it has swept away at least three fourths of the positions upon which it has been founded. The principal navigators, whose authority has been urged on this occasion, are Tasman, Juan Fernandes, Hermite, the commander of a Dutch squadron, Quiros, and Roggewein; and the track of the Endeavour has demonstrated that the land seen by these persons, and supposed to be part of a continent, is not so; it has also totally subverted the theoretical arguments which have been brought to prove that the existence of a southern continent is necessary to preserve an equilibrium between the two hemispheres; for upon this principle what we have already proved to be water, would render the southern hemisphere too light. In our rout to the northward, after doubling Cape Horn, when we were in the latitude of 40 °, our longitude was 110 0 ; and in our return to the southward, after leaving Ulietea, when we were again in latitude 40% our longitude was 145 0 ; the difference is 35 0 . When we were in latitude 30° the difference of longitude between the two tracks was 21®, which continued till we were as low as 20°; but a single view of the chart will convey a better idea of this than the most minute description : yet as upon a view of the chart it will appear that there is a large space extending quite to the Tropics, which Vol. III.

'--- J neither we, nor any other navigators to our knowledge have explored, and as there will appear to be room enough for the Cape of a southern continent to extend northward into a low southern latitude, I shall give my reasons for believing there is no Cape, of any southern continent, to the northward of 40 0 south. Notwithstanding what has been laid down by some geographers in their maps, and alleged by Mr. Dalrymple, with respect to Quiros, it is improbable in the highest degree that he saw to the southward of two istands, which he discovered in latitude 25 or 26, and which I suppose may lie between the longitude of 13o° and 140° W. any signs of a continent, much less any thing which, in his opinion, was a known or indubitable sign of such land; for if he had, he would certainly have sailed southward in search of it, and if he had sought, supposing the signs to have been indubitable, he must have found : the discovery of a southern continent was the ultimate object of Quiros's voyage, and no man appears to have had it more at heart; so that if he was in latitude 26° S. and in longitude 146° W. where Mr. Dalrymple has placed the istands he discovered, it may fairly be inferred that no part of a southern continent extends to that latitude. It will, I think, appear with ecjual evidence from the accounts of Roggewein's voyage, that between the longitudes of 130° and 150° W. there is no main land to the northward of 35 0 S. Mr. Pingre,. in a treatise concerning the transit of Venus, which he went out to observe, has inserted an extract of Roggeweirds voyage, and a map of the South Seas; and for reasons which may be seen at large in his work, supposes him, after leaving Easter Island, which he places in latitude 28 '-S. longitude 123° YV. to have fleered S.

Mr. Dairy tuple indeed supposes his rout to have been different, and that from Easter Ille he fleered N. W. taking a course afterwards very little different from that of La Maire ; but I think it is highly improbable that a man, who at his own request was sent to discover a southern continent, should take a course in which La Maire had already proved no continent could be found : it must however be confessed, that Roggewein's track cannot certainly be ascertained, because in the accounts that have been published of his voyage, neither longitudes nor latitudes are mentioned. As to myself I saw nothing that I thought a sign of land, in my rout either to the northward, southward, or westward, till a few days before I made the east coast of New Zealand: I did indeed frequently fee large stocks of birds, but they were generally such as are found at a very remote distance from any coast; and it is also true that I frequently saw pieces of rock-weed, but I could not infer the vicinity of land from these, because I have been informed, upon indubitable authority, that a considerable quantity of the beans called ox-eyes , which are known to grow no where but in the West Indies, are every year thrown up on the coast of Ireland, which is not less than twelve hundred leagues distant. Thus have I given my reasons for thinking that there is no continent to the northward of latitude 40° 8.; of what may lie farther to the southward than 40° I can give no opinion; but I am so far from wishing to discourage any future attempt, finally to determine a question which has long been an object; of attention to many nations; that now this voyage has reduced the only possible scite of a continent in the southern hemisphere, north of latitude 40°, to so small a K 2 space,"}, {"page_label": "Seite 76", "page_text": "?6 LIEUTENANT COOK's VOYAGE. 1770.

He traversed the eastern coast from latitude 34 0 to 43, and entered the {freight which divides the two islands, and in the chart is called Cook's Streight ; but being attacked by the natives soon after he came to ah anchor, in the place to which he gave the name of Murderer's Bay, he never went on shore. He gave the country the name of Staaten Land, or the land of the States, in honour of the States-General, and it is now generally distinguished in our maps and charts by the name of New Zealand. As the whole of this country, except that part of the coast which was seen by Tasman from on board his ship, has from his time, to the voyage of the Endeavour, remained altogether unknown, it has by many been supposed to be part of a southern continent. It is however now known to consist of two large islands, divided from each other by a streight or passage, which is about four or five leagues broad,. 1770, March.

The northermost of these islands is called by the natives Eaheinomauwe, and the southermost Tovy, or Tavai Poe- nammoo ; yet, as I have observed before, we are not sure whether the name Tovy Poenammoo comprehends the whole southern island, or only part of it. The figure and extent of these islands, with the situation of the bays and harbours they contain, and the smaller islands that lie about them, will appear from the chart that I have drawn, every part of which, however, I cannot vouch to be equally accurate. The coast of Eaheinomauwe, from Cape Palliser to East Cape, is laid down with great exactness, both in its figure, and the course and distance from point to point j for the opportunities that offered, and the methods that I used, were such as could scarcely admit of an error. From East Cape to St. Maria van Diemen, the chart, though perhaps not equally exact, is without any error of moment, except possibly in some few places which are here, and in 'other parts of the chart, distinguished by a dotted line, and which I had no opportunity to examine: from Cape Maria van Diemen to latitude 36° 15', we were seldom nearer the shore than between five and eight leagues; and therefore the line that marks the sea coast may possibly be erroneous. From latitude 36° 15' to nearly the length of Entry Island, our course was very near the shore, and in this part of the chart therefore there can be no material error, except perhaps at Cape Tierawitte. Between Entry Island and Cape Palliser we were again farther from the shore, and this part of the coast therefore may not be laid flown with minute exactness; yet, upon the whole, I am of opinion that this island will be found"}, {"page_label": "Seite 33", "page_text": "ROUND THE WORLD. 33 found not much to differ from the figure that I have given it, and that upon the coast there are few or no harbours which are not noticed in the journal, or delineated in the chart. I cannot however fay as much of Tovy Poenammoo, the season of the year, and the circumstances of the voyage, would not permit me to spend so much time about this island as I had employed upon the other j and the storms that we met with made it both difficult and dangerous to keep near the shore. However, from Queen Charlotte's Sound to Cape Campbel, and as far to the 8. W. as latitude 43 0 , the chart will be found pretty accurate. Between latitude 43 0 and latitude 44° 20' the line may be doubted, for of some part of the coast which it represents, we had scarcely a view. From latitude 44 0 20', to Cape Saunders, our distance would not permit me to be particular, and the weather was besides extremely unfavourable. From Cape Saunders to Cape South, and even to Cape West, there is also reason to fear that the chart will in many places be found erroneous, as we were seldom able to keep the shore, and were sometimes blown to such a distance that it could not be seen. From Cape West to Cape Farewell, and even to Charlotte's Sound, it is not more to be trusted. 1770. March. Tovy Poenammoo is for the most part a mountainous, and Country, to all appearance a barren country; and the people whom we saw in Queen Charlotte's Sound, those that came off to us under the snowy mountains, and the fires to the west of Cape Saunders, were all the inhabitants, and signs of inhabitants, that we discovered upon the whole island.

In this country there are no quadrupeds but dogs and rats, at least we saw no other, and the rats are so scarce that many of us never saw them. The dogs live with the people, who breed them for no other purpose than to eat: there might indeed be quadrupeds that we did not fee, but this is not probable, because the chief pride of the natives, with respect; to their dress, is in the skins and hair of such animals as they have, and we never saw the skin of any animal about them but those of dogs and birds: there are indeed seals upon the coast, and we once saw a sea lion, but we imagine they are seldom caught, for though we saw some of their teeth which were fashioned into an ornament like a bodkin, and worn by the natives at their breast, and highly valued, we saw none of their sic ins: there are whales also upon this coast, and though the people did not appear to have any art or instrument by which such an animal could be taken and killed, we saw pattoo-pattoos in the possession of some of them, which were made of the bone of a whale, or of some other animal whose bone had exactly the same appearance.

The sea coast is also visited by many oceanic birds, particularly albatrosses, sheerwaters, pintados, and a few of the birds which Sir John Narborough has called Penguins, and which indeed are what the French call Nuance, and seem to be a middle species between bird and fish ; for their feathers, especially those upon their wings, differ very little from scales; and their wings themselves, which they use only in diving, and not to accelerate their motion even upon the surface of the water, may, perhaps with equal propriety, be called fins. Neither are insects in greater plenty than birds: a few butterflies and beetles, flesh flies, very like those in Europe, and some musquitos and sand flies, perhaps exactly the fame with those of North'America, make up the whole catalogue. Of musquitos and sand flies, however, which are justly accounted the curse of every country where they abound, we did not see many; there were indeed a few in almost every place where we went on shore, but they gave us so little trouble, that we did not make use of the shades which we had provided for the security of our faces.

Of this article, the variety was equal to the plenty; we had mackrel of many kinds, among which, one was exactly the same as we have in England: these came in immense shoals, and were taken by the natives in their seines, who fold them to us at a very easy rate. Besides these, there were fish of many species which we had never seen before, but to all which the seamen very readily gave names ; so that we talked here as familiarly of hakes, bream, cole-fish, and many others, as we do in England ; and though they are by no means of the same family, it must be confessed that they do honour to the name. But the highest luxury which the sea afforded us, even in this place, was the lobster or sea cray-fish, which are probably the same that in the Account of Lord Anson's Voyage are said to have been found at the island of Juan Fernandes, except that, although large, they are not quite equal in size: they differ from ours in England in several particulars, they have a greater number of prickles on their backs, and they are red when first taken out of the water. These we also bought every where to the northward in great quantities of the natives, who catch them by diving near the shore, and finding out where they lie with their feet.

We had also flat fish resembling both soles and flounders, besides eels and congers of various kinds, with many others of which those who shall hereafter visit this coast will not fail to find the advantage ; and shell fish in great variety, particularly clams, cockles, and oysters.

There is another which grows in the swamps, remarkably tall and strait, thick enough to make masts for vessels of any size, and, if a judgment may be formed by the direction of its grain, very tough: this, which, as has been before remarked, our carpenter thought to resemble the pitch-pine,, may probably be lightened by tapping, and it will then make the finest masts in the world : it has a leaf not unlike a yew, and bears berries in small bunches. 2 Great"}, {"page_label": "Seite 38", "page_text": "38 LIEUTENANT COOK'S VOYAGE 177°* Great part of the country is covered with a luxuriant ver- ,- v -jj dure, and our natural historians were gratified by the novelty, if not the variety of the plants.

From the same plant, by another preparation, they draw long slender fibres which shine like silk, and are as white as snow: of these, which are also surprisingly strong, the finer clothes are made; and of the leaves, without any other preparation than splitting them into proper breadths, and tying the strips together, they make their fishing nets; some of which, as I have before remarked, are of an enormous size.

In either place there would be the advantage of an excellent harbour; and, by means of the river, settlements might be extended, and a communication established with the inland parts of the country : vessels might be built of the sine timber which abounds in these parts, at very little trouble and expence, fit for such a navigation as would answer the purpose. I cannot indeed exactly assign the depth of water which a vessel intended to navigate this river, even as far up as I went with the boat, should draw, because this depends upon the depth of water that is upon the bar, or flats, which lie before the narrow part of the river, for I had no opportunity to make myself acquainted with them ; but I am of opinion, that a vessel which should draw not more than twelve feet would perfectly answer the purpose.

Saturday 26. At fix in the morning we weighed, with a gentle breeze at South, and stood away to the N.W. between the outermost range of islands and the main, leaving several small istands between the main and the ship, which we passed at a very little distance: our soundings being irregular, from twelve to four fathom, I sent a boat ahead to found. At noon we were about three miles from the main, and about the fame distance from the istands without us: our latitude by observation was 23° 7' S.: the main land here is high and mountainous ; the istands which lie off it are also most of them high, and of a small circuit, having an appearance rather of barrenness than fertility. At this time we saw smoke in many places at a considerable distance inland, and therefore conjectured that there might be a lagoon, river, or inlet running up the country, the rather as we had passed two places which had the appearance of being such; but our depth of water was too little to encourage me to venture where 1 should probably have less. We had not stood to the northward above an hour, before we suddenly fell into three fathom ; upon which I anchored, and sent away the Master to sound the channel which lay to leeward of us, between the northermost island and the main : it appeared to be pretty broad, but I suspected that it was shallow, and so indeed it was found ; for the master reported at his return thn in many places he had only two fathom and an 7 half,"}, {"page_label": "Seite 121", "page_text": "ROUND THE WORLD. 121 half, and where we lay at anchor we had only sixteen feet, 1770. which was not two feet more than the ship drew. While the _ > master was sounding the channel, Mr. Banks tried to fifli from Saturday 261 the cabbin windows with hook and line: the water was too shallow for fifli; but the ground was almost covered with crabs, which readily took the bait, and sometimes held it so fast in their claws, that they did not quit their hold till they were considerably above water. These crabs were of two forts, and both of them such as we had not seen before: one of them was adorned with the finest blue that can be imagined, in every respect equal to the ultramarine, with which all his claws, and every joint was deeply tinged: the under part of him was white, and so exquisitely polished that in. colour and brightness it exactly resembled the white of old china: the other was also marked with the ultramarine upon his joints and his toes, but somewhat more sparingly; and his back was marked with three brown spots which had a singular appearance. The people who had been out with the boat to found, reported, that upon an ifland where we had observed two sires, they had seen several of the inhabitants, who called to them, and seemed very desirous that they should land. In the evening, the wind veered to E. N. E. which gave us an opportunity to stretch three or four miles back by the way we came; after which, the wind shifted to the South, and obliged us again to anchor in six fathom.

It may perhaps, at first, seem strange, that where there is so little to be got by victory, there should so often be war; and that every little district of a country inhabited by people so mild and placid, should be at enmity with all the rest. But possibly more is to be gained by victory among these people than at first appears, and they may be prompted to mutual hostilities by motives which no degree of friendship or affection is able to resist. It appears, by the account that has already been given of them, that their principal food is fish, which can only be procured upon the sea coast; and there, in sufficient quantities, only at certain times: the tribes, therefore, who live inland, if any such there are, and even those upon the coast, must be frequently in danger of perishing by famine. Their country produces neither sheep, nor goats, nor hogs, nor cattle ; tame fowls they have none, nor any art by which those that are wild can be caught in sufficient plenty to serve as provision. If there are any whose situation cuts them off from a supply of fish, the only succedaneum of all other animal food, except dogs, they have nothing to support life, but the vegetables that have already been mentioned, of which the chief are fern root, yams, clams, and potatoes: when by any accident these fail, the distress must be dreadful ; and even among the inhabitants of the coast, many tribes must frequently be reduced to nearly the fame situation, either by the failure of their plantations, or the deficiency of their dry stock, during the season when but few fish are to be caught.

It may however be remarked, that, if this account of the origin of so horrid a practice is true, the mischief does by no means end with the necessity that produced it: after the practice has been once begun on one side by hunger, it will naturally be adopted on the other by revenge. Nor is this all, for though it may be pretended, by some who wish to appear speculative and philosophical, that whether the dead body of an enemy be eaten or buried, is in itself a matter perfectly indifferent; as it is, whether the breasts and thighs of a woman should be covered or naked; and that prejudice and habit only make us shudder at the violation of custom in one instance, and blush at it in the other : yet, leaving this as a point of doubtful disputation, to be discussed at leisure, it may safely be affirmed, that the practice of eating human flesh, whatever it may be in itself, is relatively, and in its consequences, most pernicious; tending manifestly to eradicate a principle which is the chief security of human life, and more frequently restrains the hand of murder than the sense of duty, or even the fear of punishment. -1 Among those who are accustomed to eat the dead, death must have lost much of its horror ; and where there is little horror at the sight of death, there will not be much repugnance to kill. A fense of duty, and fear of punishment, may be more easily surmounted than the feelings of Nature, or those which have been engrafted upon Nature by early prejudice and uninterrupted custom.

But there is the strongest reason to believe, that those who have been so accustomed to prepare a human body for a meal, that they can with as little feeling cut up a dead man, as our cook-maids divide a dead rabbit for a fricassee, would feel as little horror in committing a murder as in picking a pocket, and consequently would take away life with as little compunction as property; so that men, under these circumstances, would be made murderers by the flight temptations that now make them thieves. If any man doubts whether this reasoning is conclusive, let him a sic himself, whether in his own opinion he should not be safer with a man in whom the horror of destroying life is strong, whether in consequence of natural instinct unsubdued, or of early prejudice, which has nearly an equal influence ; than in the power of a man who under any temptation to murder him would be restrained only by considerations of interest; for to these all motives of mere duty may be reduced, as they must terminate either in hope of good, or fear of evil. The situation and circumstances, however, of these poor people, as well as their temper, are favourable to those who shall fettle as a colony among them. Their situation sets them in need of protection, and their temper renders it easy to attach them by kindness; and whatever may be said in favour of a savage life, among people who live in luxurious idleness upon the bounty of Nature, civilization would certainly be a blessing to those whom her parsimony scarcely furnishes with the bread of life, and who are perpetually destroying each other by violence, as the only alternative of perishing by hunger. 8 But 1770.

At first, they had no notion of any superiority but numbers; and when this was on their side, they considered all our expressions of kindness as the artifices of fear and cunning, to circumvent them, and preserve ourselves : but when they were once convinced of our power, after having provoked us to the use of our fire-arms, though loaded only with small shot and of our clemency, by our forbearing to make use of weapons so dreadful except in our defence ; they became at once friendly, and even affectionate, placing in us the most unbounded 'Confidence, and doing every thing which could incite us to put equal confidence in them. It is also remarkable, that when an intercourse was once established between us, they were very rarely detected in any act of dishonesty. Before, indeed, and while they considered us as enemies, who came upon their coast only to make an advantage of them, they did not scruple by any means to make an advantage of us; and would, therefore, when they had received the price of any thing they had offered to fell, pack up both the purchase and the purchase-money with all possible composure, as so much lawful plunder from people who had no view but to plunder them. I have observed that our friends in the South Seas had not even the idea of indecency, with respect to any object or any action ; but this was by no means the cafe with the inhabitants of New Zealand, in whose carriage and conversation there was as much modest reserve and decorum with respect to actions, which yet in their opinion were not criminal, as are to be found among the politest people in Europe.

When any of our people made an overture to one of their young women, he was given to understand that the consent of her friends was necessary, and by the influence of a proper present, it was generally obtained ; but when these preliminaries were settled, it was also necessary to treat the wife for a night, with the same delicacy that is here required by the wife for life, and the lover who presumed to take any liberties by which this was violated, was sure to be disappointed. One of our gentlemen having made his addresses to a family of the better fort, received an answer, which, translated into our language, according to the mode and spirit of it, as well as the letter, would have been exactly in these terms : \" Any of these young ladies will think themselves honoured by your addresses, but you must first make me a suitable present, and you must then come and sleep with us on shore, for daylight must by no means be a witness of what passes between you.\" I have already observed, that in personal cleanliness they are not quite equal to our friends at Otaheite ; because, not having the advantage of so warm a climate, they do not so often go into the water; but the most disgustful thing about them is the oil, with which, like the Islanders, they anoint their hair: it is certainly the fat either of fish or of birds, melted down, and though the better fort have it fresh, their inferiors use that which is rancid, and consequently are almost as disagreeable to the smell as a Hottentot ; neither are their heads free from vermin, though we observed that they were furnished with combs, both of bone and woodthese combs are sometimes worn stuck upright in the hair as an ornament. 1770.

The men generally wear their beards short, and their hair tied upon the crown of the head in a bunch, in which they stick the feathers of various birds, in different manners, according to their fancies; sometimes one is placed on each fide of the temples, pointing forwards, which we thought made a very disagreeable appearance. The women wear their hair sometimes cropped short, and sometimes flowing over their shoulders. The bodies of both sexes are marked with the black stains called Amoco, by the fame method that is used at Otaheite, and called Tattowing; but the men are more marked, and the women less. The women in general stain no part of their bodies but the lips, though sometimes they are marked with small black patches on other parts: the men, on the contrary, seem to add something every year to the ornaments of the last, so that some of them, who appeared to be of an advanced age, were almost covered from head to foot. Besides the Amoco, they have marks impressed by a method unknown to us, of a very extraordinary kind: they are furrows of about a line deep, and a line broad, such as appear upon the bark of a tree which has been cut through, after a year's growth: the edges of these furrows are afterwards indented by the same method, and being perfectly black, they make a most frightful appearance. The faces of the old men are almost covered with these marks; those who arc very young, black only their lips like the women; when they are somewhat older, they have generally a black patch upon one cheek, and over one eye, and so proceed gradually, that they may grow old and honourable together: but though we could not but be disgusted with the horrid deformity which these stains and furrows produced in the \" human face divine,\" we could not but admire the dexterity"}, {"page_label": "Seite 49", "page_text": "ROUND THE WORLD. 49 rity and art with which they were impreffed. The marks upon ^77°* the face in general are spirals, which are drawn with great *-.- nicety, and even elegance, those on one side exactly corresponding with those on the other: the marks on the body somewhat resemble the foliage in old chased ornaments, and the convolutions of fillagree work; but in these they have such a luxuriance of fancy, that of an hundred, which at first sight appeared to be exactly the same, no two were, upon a close examination, found to be alike. We observed, that the quantity and form of these marks were different in different parts of the coast, and that as the principal seat of them at Otaheite was the breech, in New Zealand it was sometimes the only part which was free, and in general was less distinguished than any other. The skins of these people, however, are not only dyed, but painted, for, as I have before observed, they smear their bodies with red oker, some rubbing it on dry, and some applying it in large patches mixed with oil, which is always wet, and which the least touch will rub off, so that the transgressions of such of our people as were guilty of ravishing a kiss from these blooming beauties, were most legibly written, upon their faces. The dress of a New Zealander is certainly, to a stranger at first sight, the most uncouth that can be imagined. It is made of the leaves of the stag, which has been described among the vegetable productions of this country : these leaves are split into three or four flips, and the slips, when they are dry, interwoven with each other into a kind of stuff between netting and cloth, with all the ends, which are eight or nine inches long, hanging out on the upper side, like the shag or thrumb matts, which we sometimes fee lying in a passage.

The inhabitants of the South Sea islands slit up the prepuce so as to prevent it from covering the glans of the penis, but these people, on the contrary, bring the prepuce over the glans, and to prevent it from being drawn back by the contraction of the part, they tie the string which hangs from their girdle, round the end of it. The glans indeed seemed to be the only part of their body which they were solicitous to conceal, for they frequently threw off all their dress but the belt and string, with the most careless indifference, but shewed manifest signs of confusion, when, to gratify our curiosity, they were requested to untie the string, and never consented but with the utmost reluctance and shame. When they have only their upper garment on, and sit upon their hams, they bear some resemblance to a thatched house; but this covering, though it is ugly, is well adapted to the use of those who frequently sleep in the open air, without any other shelter from the rain. But besides this course shag or thatch, they have two sorts of cloth, which have an even surface, and are very ingeniously made, in the same manner with that manufactured by the inhabitants of South America, some of which we procured at Rio de Janeiro.

This is frequently striped, and always had a pretty appearance, for it is composed of the fibres of the fame plant, which are prepared so as to shine like silk. It is made in a kind of frame of the size of the cloth, generally about five feet long, and four broad, across which the long threads, which lie close together, or warp, are strained, and the cross threads, or woof, are worked in by hand, which must be a very tedious operation. To both these kinds of cloth they work borders of different colours, in stitches, somewhat like carpeting, or rather like those used in the samplars which girls work at school. These borders are of various patterns, and wrought with a neatness, and even an elegance, which, considering they have no needle, is surprizing: but the great pride of their dress consists in the fur of their dogs, which they use with such œconemy that they cut it into stripes, and few them upon their cloth at a distance from each other, which is a strong proof that dogs are not plenty among them; these stripes are also of different colours, and disposed so as to produce a pleasing effect. We saw some dresses that were adorned with feathers instead of fur, but these were not common; and we saw one that was intirely covered with the red feathers of the parrot. The dress of the man who was killed, when we first went ashore in Poverty Ray, has been described already ; but we saw the same dress only once more during our stay upon the coast, and that was in Queen Charlotte's Sound.

The women, contrary to the custom of the sex in general, . , ' * seemed to affect dress rather less than the men: their hair, which, as I have observed before, is generally cropt short, is never tied upon the top of the head when it is suffered to be long, nor is it ever adorned with feathers. Their garments were made of the same materials, and in the same form, as those of the other sex, but the lower one was always bound fast round them, except when they went into the water to catch lobsters, and then they took great care not to be seen by the men. Some of us happening one day to land upon a small island in Tolaga Bay, we surprized several of them at this employment; and the chaste Diana, with her nymphs, could not have discovered more confusion and distress at the sight of Actaeon, than these women expressed upon our approach. Some of them hid themselves among the rocks, and the rest crouched down in the sea till they had made themselves a girdle and apron of such weeds as they could find, and when they came out, even with this veil, we could perceive that their modesty suffered much pain by our presence. The girdle and apron which they wear in common, have been mentioned before. Both sexes bore their ears, and by stretching them the holes become large enough to admit a finger at least. In* these holes they wear ornaments of various kinds, cloth,, feathers, bones of large birds, and even sometimes a stick of- wood; and to these receptacles of finery they generally applied the nails which we gave them, and every thing which it was possible they could contain.

Besides the ornaments that are thrust 1770. through the holes of the ears, many others are suspended to \"... --j them by strings ; such as chistels or bodkins made of green talc, upon which they set a high value, the nails and teeth of their deceased relations, the teeth of dogs, and every thing else that they can get, which they think either curious or valuable. The women also wear bracelets and anclets, made of the bones of birds, shells, or any other substances which they can perforate and string upon a thread. The men had sometimes hanging to a string, which went round the neck, a piece of green talc, or whalebone, somewhat in the shape of a tongue, with the rude figure of a man carved upon it; and upon this ornament they set a high value. In one instance, we saw the gristle that divides the nostrils, and called by anatomists, the septum nafi , perforated, and a feather thrust through the hole, which projected on each side over the cheeks; it is probable that this frightful singularity was intended as an ornament, but of the many people we saw, we never observed it in any other, nor even a perforation that might occasionally serve for such a purpose.

That part of the floor which is allotted for the fire-place, is enclosed in a hollow square, by partitions either of wood or stone, and in the middle of it the fire is kindled. The floor, along the inside of the walls, is thickly covered with straw, and upon this the family sleep. Their furniture and implements consist of but few articles and one chest commonly contains them all, except their provision-bafkets, the gourds that hold their fresh water and the hammers that are used to beat their fern-roor, which generally stand without the door: some rude tools, their cloaths, arms, and a few feathers to stick in their hair, make the rest of their treasure. Some of the better sort, whose families are large, have three or four houses enclosed within a court-yard, the walls of which are constructed of poles and hay, and are about ten or twelve feet high. When we were on shore in the district called Tolaga, we saw the ruins, or rather the frame of a house, for it had , never been finished, much superior in size to any that we law elsewhere: it was thirty feet in length, about fifteen in breadth, and twelve high: the sides of it were adorned with many carved planks, of a workmanship much superior to any other that we had met with in the country; but for what"}, {"page_label": "Seite 55", "page_text": "ROUND THE WORLD. 55 what purpose it was built, or why it was deserted, we could never learn. Rut these people, though in their houses they are so well defended from the inclemency of the weather, seem to be quite indifferent whether they have any shelter at all during, their excursions in search of fern roots and fish, sometimes, setting up a small shade to windward, and sometimes altogether neglecting even that precaution, sleeping with their women and children under husoes, with their weapons ranged round them, in the manner that has already been described.

To the northward, as I have observed, there are plantations of yams, sweet potatoes, and coccos, but we saw no such to the southward ; the inhabitants therefore of that part of the country must subsist wholly upon fern root and fish, except the scanty and accidental resource which they may find in sea fowl and dogs ; and that fern and fish are not to be procured at all seasons of the year, even at the sea side, and upon the neighbouring hills, is manifest from the stores of both that we saw laid up dry, and the reluctance which some of them exprefled at selling any part of them to us when we offered to purchase them, at least the fish, for sea stores : and this particular seems to confirm my opinion that this country scarcely sustains the present num- 1 ber of its inhabitants, who are urged to perpetual hostilities by hunger, which naturally prompted them to eat the dead bodies of those who were stain in the contest. Water is their universal and only liquor, as far as we could discover, and if they have really no means of intoxication, they are, in this particular, happy beyond any other people that we have yet seen or heard of. As there is perhaps no source of disease either critical or chronic, but intemperance and inactivity, it cannot be thought strange that these people enjoy perfect and uninterrupted health: in all our visits to their towns, where young and old, men and women, crowded about us, prompted by the same curiosity that carried us to look at them, we never saw a single person who appeared to have any bodily complaint, nor among the numbers that we have seen naked, did we once perceive the slightest eruption upon the skin, or any marks that an eruption had left behind: at first, indeed, A observing"}, {"page_label": "Seite 57", "page_text": "ROUND THE WORLD. 57 observing tliat some of them when they came off to us were marked in patches with a white flowery appearance upon different parts of their bodies, we thought that they were leperous, or highly scorbutic; but upon examination we found that these marks were owing to their having been wetted by the spray of the sea in their paflage, which, when it was dried away, left the salts behind it in a fine white powder. Another proof of health, which we have mentioned upon a former occasion, is the facility with which the wounds healed that had left scars behind them, and that we saw in a recent state; when we saw the man who had been shot with a musket ball through the fleshy part of his arm, his wound seemed to be so well digested, and in so fair a way of being perfectly healed, that if I had not known no application had been made to it, I should certainly have enquired, with a very interested curiosity, after the vulnerary herbs and surgical art of the country. A farther proof that human nature is here untainted with disease, is the great number @f old men that we saw, many of whom, by the loss of their hair and teeth, appeared to be very ancient, yet none of them were decrepit, and though not equal to the young in muscular strength, were not a whit behind them in cheerfulness and vivacity.

All their canoes, ex- , cept a few at Opoorage or Mercury Bay, which were of one piece, and hollowed by fire, are built after this plan, and few are less than twenty feet long: some of the smaller sort have outriggers, and sometimes two of them are joined together, but this is not common. The carving upon the stern and head ornaments of the inferior boats, which seem to be intended wholly for fishing, consists of the figure of a man, with a face as ugly as can be conceived, and a monstrous tongue thrust out of the mouth, with the white shells of sea-ears stuck in for the eyes. But the canoes of the superior kind, which seem to be their men of war, are magnificently adorned with open work, and covered with loose fringes of black feathers, which had a most elegant appearance : the gunwale boards were also frequently carved in a grotesque taste, and adorned with tufts of white feathers placed upon a black ground. Of visible objects that are wholly new, no verbal description can convey a just idea, but in proportion as they resemble some that are already known, to which the mind of the reader must be referred: the carving of these people being of a singular kind, and not in the likeness of any thing that is known on our side of the ocean, either \" in the heaven above, or in the \" earth beneath, or in the waters that are under the earth,\" I must refer wholly to the representations which will be found of it in Plate XV.

By the help of these oars they push i_- r on their boats with amazing velocity. In sailing they are not expert, having no art of going otherwise than before the wind: the sail is of netting or matt, which is set up between two poles that are fixed upright upon each gunwale, and serve both for masts and yards: two ropes answered the purpose of sheets, and were consequently fastened above to the top of each pole. But clumsy and inconvenient as this apparatus is, they make good way before the wind, and are steered by two men who sit in the stern, with each a paddle in his hand for that purpose. Tool*. Having said thus much of their workmanship, I lhall now give some account of their tools; they have adzes, axes, and eliissels, which serve them also as augers for the boring of holes: as they have no metal, their adzes and axes are made of a hard black stone, or of a green talc, which is not only hard but tough; and their chisels of human bone, or small' fragments of jasper, which they chip off from a block in sharp angular pieces like a gun-flint. Their axes they value above all that they possess, and never would part with one of them for any thing that we could give: I once offered one of the best axes I had in the ship, besides a number of other things for one of them, but the owner would not fell it; from which I conclude that good ones are scarce among them. Their small tools of jasper, which are used in finishing their nicest work, they use till they are blunt, and then, as they have no means of sharpening them, throw them away. We had given the people at Tolaga a piece of glass, and in a short time they found, means to drill a hole through it, in order to hang it round the neck as an ornament by a thread ; and we imagine the tool must have been a piece of this jasper.

Their nets, particularly their seine, which is of an enor- Nets. mous size, have been mentioned already: one of these seems to be the joint work of a whole town, and I suppose it to be the joint property also : the other net, which is circular, and extended by two or three hoops, has been particularly described as well as the manner of baiting and using it. Their hooks are of bone or shell, and in general are ill made. To receive the fish when it is caught, and to hold their other provisions, they have baskets of various kinds and dimensions, very neatly made of wicker-work. They excel in tillage, as might naturally be expected Tillage,*, where the person that sows is to eat the produce, and where there is so little besides that can be eaten : when we first came to Tegadoo, a district between Poverty Bay and East Cape, their crops were just covered, and had not yet begun to sprout; the mould was as smooth as in a garden, and. every root had its small hillock, ranged in a regular quincunx by lines, which with the pegs were still remaining in the field. We had not an opportunity to fee any of these husbandmen work, but we saw what serves them at once for spade and plough: this instrument is nothing more than a long narrow stake sharpened to an edge at one end, with a short piece fastened transversely at a little distance above it, for the convenience of pressing it down with the foot. With this they turn up pieces of ground six or seven acres in extent, though it is not more than three inches broad; but as the foil is light and sandy it makes little resistance- Tillage,,"}, {"page_label": "Seite 62", "page_text": "6r LIEUTENANT COOK'S VOYAGE 1770.

Tillage, weaving, and the other arts of peace, seem to be best known and most.practised in the northern part of this country; for there is little appearance of any of them in the South : but the arts of war flourish equally through the whole coast. Of weapons they have no great variety, but such as they have are well fitted for destruction ; they have spears, darts, battle-axes, and the Patoo-Patoo. The spear is fourteen or fifteen feet long, pointed at both ends, and sometimes headed with bone : these are grasped by the middle, so that the part behind balancing that before, makes a push more difficult to be parried, than that of a weapon which is held by the end. The dart and other weapons have been sufficiently described already; and it has also been remarked, that these people have neither fling nor bow. They throw the dart by hand, and so they do stones; but darts and stones are seldom used except in defending their forts. Their battles, whether in boats or on shore, are generally hand to hand, and the slaughter must consequently be great, as a second blow with any of their weapons is unnecessary, if the first takes place: their trust, however, seems to be principally placed in the Patoo-Patoo, which is fastened to their wrists by a strong strap, lest it should be wrenched from them, and which the principal people generally wear sticking in their girdles, considering it as a military ornament, and part of their dress, like the poinard of the Asiatic, and the sword of the European. They have no defensive armour; but, besides their weapons, the Chiefs carried a staff of distinction, in the same manner as our officers do the spontoon: this was generally the rib-of a whale, as white as snow, with many ornaments of carved work, dog's hair, and feathers; but sometimes it was a stick, about six feet long, adorned in the"}, {"page_label": "Seite 63", "page_text": "ROUND THE WORLD. the same manner, and inlaid with a shell like mother-of- pearl. Those who bore this mark of distinction were generally old, at least past the middle age, and were also more marked with the Amoco than the rest.. One or more persons, thus distinguished, always appeared in each canoe, when they came to attack us, according to the size of it. When they came within about a cable's length of the ship, they used to stop, and the Chiefs rising from their feat, put on a dress which seemed appropriated to the occasion, generally of dog's skin, and holding out their decorated staff, or a weapon, directed the rest of the people what they should do. When they were at too great a distance to reach us with a lance or a stone, they presumed that we had no weapon with which we could reach them; here then the defiance was given, and the words were almost universally the fame, Haromai , haromai , bar re uta a P atoo-P atoo oge : \" Come to \" us, come on shore, and we will kill you all with our ' \" Patoo-Patoos.\" While they were uttering these menaces- they came gradually nearer and nearer, till they were close alongside; talking at intervals in a peaceable strain, and answering any questions that we asked them; and at intervals- renewing their defiance and threats, till being encouraged by our apparent timidity, they began their war-song and dance, as a prelude to an attack, which always followed, and was sometimes continued till it became absolutely necessary to repress them by firing some small-shot; and sometimes ended after throwing a few stones on board, as if content with having offered us an insult which we did not dare to revenge.

This horrid dance is always accompanied by a song; it is wild indeed, but not disagreeable, and every strain ends in a loud and deep sigh, which they utter in concert. In the motions of the dance, however horrid, there is a strength, firmness, and agility, which we could not but behold with admiration; and in their song they keep time with such exactness, that I have often heard above an hundred paddles struck against the sides of their boats at once, so as to produce but a single found, at the divisions of their music. A song not altogether unlike this, they sometimes sing without the dance, and as a peaceable amusement : they have also other songs which are sung by the women, whose voices are remarkably mellow and soft, and have a pleasing and tender effect; the time is slow, and the cadence mournful; but it is conducted with more taste than could be expected among the poor ignorant savages of this half desolate country ; especially as it appeared to us, who were none of us much acquainted with music as a science, to be sung in parts; it was at least fung by many voices at the same time. They have sonorous instruments, but they can scarcely be called instruments of music; one is the shell, called the Triton's trumpet, with which they make a noise not unlike that which our boys sometimes make with a cow's horn: the other is a small wooden pipe, resembling a child's nine-pin, only much smaller, and in this there is no more music than in"}, {"page_label": "Seite 65", "page_text": "ROUND THE WORLD. 6 S in a pea-whistle.

To what has been already said of the practice of eating human flesh, I shall only add, that in almost every cove where we landed, we found flesh bones of men near the places where sires had been made; and that among the heads that were brought on board by the old man, some seemed to have false eyes, and ornaments in their ears as if alive. That which Mr. Banks bought was fold with great reluctance by the possessor: the head was manifestly that of a young person about fourteen or fifteen years of age, and by the contusions on one side appeared to have received many violent blows, and indeed a part of the bone near the eye ■ was wanting. These appearances confirmed us in the opinion that the natives of this country give no quarter, nor take any prisoners to be killed and eaten at a future time, as is said to have been a practice among the Indians of Florida: for if prisoners had been taken, this poor young creature, who cannot be supposed capable of making much resistance, would probably have been one, and we knew that he was killed with the rest, for the fray had happened but a few days before. The towns or Hippahs of these people, which are all fortified, have been sufficiently described already, and from the Bay of Plenty to Queen Charlotte's Sound they seem to be the constant residence of the people: but about Poverty Bay, Hawke's Bay, Tegadoo, and Tolaga, we saw no Hippahs, but single houses scattered at a distance from each other; yet upon the sides of the hills there were stages of a great length, furnished with stones and darts, probably as retreats for the Vol. III.

We observed, that among the trees on shore, which were not very large, there was no underwood ; and could distinguish that many of them were of the palm kind, and some of them cabbage trees : after many a wishful look we were obliged to return, with our curiosity rather excited than satisfied, and about five in the evening got on board the ship.

The pinnace, which had been sent ahead to sound, now approached the place, upon which all the Indians retired farther up the hill, except one, who hid himself among some rocks near the landing-place. As the pinnace proceeded along the shore, most of the people took the same route, and kept abreast of her at a distance ; when she came back, the master told us, that in a cove a little within the harbour, some of them had come down to the beach, and invited him to land by many signs and words of which he knew not the meaning; but that all of therm were armed with long pikes, and a wooden weapon shaped somewhat like a cimeter.

A third ihusquet with small shot was then fired at them, upon which one of them threw another lance, and both immediately ran away: if we had pursued, we might probably have taken one of them; but Mr. Banks suggesting that the lances might be poisoned, I thought it not prudent to venture into the woods. We repaired immediately to the huts, in one of which we found the children, who had hidden themselves behind a shield and some bark; we peeped at them, but lest them in their retreat, without their knowing that they had been discovered, and we threw into the house when we went away some beads, ribbons, pieces of cloth, and other presents, which we hoped would procure us the good-will of the inhabitants when they should return; but the lances which we found lying about, we took away with us, to the number of about fifty : they were from fix to fifteen feet long, and all of them had four prongs in the manner of a fisb-gig, each of which was pointed with fish-bone, and very sharp: we observed that they were smeared with a viscous substance of a green colour, which favoured the opinion of their being poisoned, though we afterwards discovered that it was a mistake : they appeared, by the sea-weed that we found sticking to them, to have been used in striking fish. Upon examining the canoes that lay upon the beach, we found them to be the worst we had ever seen: they were between twelve and fourteen feet long, and made of the bark of a tree in one piece, which was drawn together and tied up at each end, the middle being kept open by sticks which were placed across them from gunwale to gunwale as thwarts.

In the morning, therefore, I sent a party of men to that Sunday zg . part of the shore where we first landed, with orders to dig holes in the sand where the water might gather; but going ashore myself with the Gentlemen soon afterwards, we found, upon a more diligent search, a small stream, more than sufficient for our purpose. Upon visiting the hut where we had seen the children, we were greatly mortified to find that the beads and ribbons which we had left there the night before, had not been moved from their places, and that not an Indian was to be seen. Having sent some empty water-casks on shore, and left a party of men to cut wood, I went myself in the pinnace to sound, and examine the bay; during my excursion I saw several of the natives, but they all fled at my approach. In one of the places where I landed I found several small fires, and fresh muscles broiling upon them; here also I found some of the largest oyster-shells I had ever seen. As soon as the wooders and waterers came on board to dinner, ten or twelve of the natives came down to the place, and looked with great attention and curiosity at the castes, but did not touch them: they took away however the canoes which lay near the landing-place, and again disappeared.

As soon as it was light, they were seen walking along the beach; and soon after they retired to the woods, where, at the distance of about a mile from the shore, they kindled several fires. Our people went ashore as usual, and with them Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, who, in search of plants, repaired to the woods. Our men, who were employed in cutting grafs, being the farthest removed from the main body of the people, a company of fourteen or fifteen Indians advanced towards them, having sticks in their hands, which, according to the report of the Serjeant of the marines, shone like a musquet. The grass-cutters, upon seeing them approach, drew together, and repaired to the main body. The Indians, being encouraged by this appearance of a flight, pursued them; they stopped however when they were within about a furlong of them, and after shouting several times went back into the woods.

Early the next morning, the body of Forby Sutherland, May, one of our seamen, who died the evening before, was buried Tuesday near the watering-place; and from this incident I called the south point of this bay Sutherland Point. This day we resolved to make an excursion into the country. Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander, myself, and seven others, properly accoutred for the expedition, set out, and repaired first to the huts, near the watering-place, whither some of the natives continued every day to resort; and though the little presents which we had left there before had not yet been taken away, we left others of somewhat more value, consisting of cloth, looking-glasses, combs, and beads, and then went up into the country. We found the foil to be either swamp or light sand, and the face of the country finely diversified by wood and lawn. The trees are tall, strait, and without underwood, standing at such a distance from each other that the whole country, at least where the swamps do not render it incapable of cultivation, might be cultivated without cutting down one of them: between the trees the ground is covered with grafs, of which there is great abundance, growing in tufts about as big as can well be grasped in the hand, which stand very close to each other. We saw many houses of the inhabitants, and places where they had slept upon the grafs without any shelter; but we saw only one of the people, who the moment he discovered us ran away. At all these places we left presents, hoping that at length they might produce confidence and good-will. We had"}, {"page_label": "Seite 94", "page_text": "94 LIEUTENANT COOK'S VOYAGE 1770.

We afterwards saw the dung of an animal which fed upon grass, and which we judged could not be less than a deer; and the footsteps of another, which was clawed like a dog, and seemed to be about as big as a wolf: we also tracked a small animal, whose foot resembled that of a polcat or weasel. The trees over our head abounded with birds of various kinds, among which were many of exquisite beauty, particularly loriquets and cockatoos, which flew in flocks of several scores together. We found some wood which had been felled by the natives with a blunt instrument, and some that had been barked. The trees were not of many species ; among others there was a large one which yielded a gum not unlike the Sanguis dracoms ; and in some of them steps had been cut at about three feet distance from each other, for the convenience of climbing them. From this excursion we returned between three and four o'clock, and having dined on board, we went ashore again at the watering-place, where a party of men were filling calks. Mr. Gore, the Second Lieutenant, had been sent out in the morning with a boat to dredge for oysters at the head of the bay; when he had performed this service, he went ashore, and having taken a midshipman with him, and sent the boat away, set out to join the waterers by land. In his way he fell in with a body of two and twenty Indians, who followed him, and were often not more than twenty yards distant; when Mr. Gore perceived them so near, he stopped, and faced about, upon which they stopped also; and when he went on"}, {"page_label": "Seite 95", "page_text": "95 ROUND THE WORLD. . > on again, continued their pursuit: fhey did not however attack him, though they were all armed with lances, and he and the midshipman got in safety to the watering-place. The Indians, who had slackened their pursuit when they came in fight of the main body of our people, halted at about the distance of a quarter of a mile, where they stood still. Mr. Monkho.use and two or three of the waterers took it in their head to march up to them; but seeing the Indians keep their ground till they came pretty near them, they were seized with a sudden fear very common to the rash and fool-hardy, and made a hasty retreat: this step, which insured the danger that it was taken to avoid, encouraged the Indians, and four of them running forward discharged their lances at the fugitives, with such force that, flying no less than forty yards, they went beyond them. As the Indians did not pursue, our people, recovering their spirits, stopped to collect the lances when they came up to the place where they lay; upon which the Indians, in their turn, began to retire. Just at this time I came up, with Mr. Banks, Dr. So- lander, and Tupia; and being desirous to convince the Indians that we were neither afraid of them, nor intended them any mischief, we advanced towards them, making signs of expostulation and entreaty, but they could not be persuaded to wait till we could come up. Mr. Gore told us, that he had seen some of them up the bay, who had invited him by signs to come on shore, which he, certainly with great prudence, declined. The morning of the next day was so rainy, that we were all glad to stay on board. In the afternoon, however, it cleared up, and we made another excursion along the sea- coast to the southward: we went ashore, and Mr. Banks and' Dr. Solander gathered many plants; but besides these we saw nothing worthy of notice.

By the boldness of these people at our first landing, and the terror that seized them at the sight of us afterwards, it appears that they were sufficiently intimidated by our fire-arms: not that we had any reason to think the people much hurt by the small-shot which we were obliged to sire at them, when they attacked us at our coming out of the boat; but they had probably seen the effects of them, from their lurking-places, upon the birds that we had shot. Tupia, who was now become a good marksman, frequently strayed from us to shoot parrots; and he had told us, that while he was thus employed, he had 'once met with nine Indians, who, as soon as they perceived he saw them, ran from him, in great confusion and terror. The next day, twelve canoes, in each of which was a single Indian, came towards the watering-place, and were within half a mile of it a considerable time: they were employed in striking fish, upon which, like others that we had seen before, they were so intent that they seemed to regard nothing else. It happened, however, that a party of our people were out a shooting near the place, and one of the men, whose curiosity might at length perhaps be roused by the report of the fowling-pieces, was observed by Mr. Banks to haul up his canoe upon the beach, and go towards the shooting party: in something more than a quarter of an hour he returned, launched his canoe, and went off in her to his companions.

While Mr. Banks was gathering plants near the watering- place, I went with Dr. Solander and Mr. Monkhoufe to the head of the bay, that I might examine that part of the country, and make farther attempts to form some connection with the natives. In our way we met with eleven or twelve small canoes, with each a man in it, probably the fame that were afterwards abreast of the shore, who all made into shoal water upon our approach. We met other Indians on shore the first time we landed, who instantly took to their canoes, and paddled away. We went up the country to some distance, and found the face of it nearly the same with that which has been described already, but the soil was much richer; for instead of sand, I found a deep black mould, which I thought very fit for the production of grain of any kind. In the woods we found a tree which bore fruit that in colour and shape resembled a cherry > the juice had an agreeable tartness, though but little flavour. We found also interspersed some of the finest meadows in the world: some places however were rocky, but these were comparatively few: the stone is sandy, and might be used with advantage for building. When we returned to the boat, we saw some smoke upon another part of the coast, and went thither in hopes of meeting with the people, but at our approach, these also ran away. We found six small canoes, and fix fires very near the beach, with some muscles roasting upon them, and a few oysters lying near: by this we judged that there had been one man in each canoe, who having picked up some shell-fish had come ashore to eat it, and made his separate fire for that purpose: we tasted of their cheer, and left them in return some strings of beads, and other things Vol. III.

At the foot of a tree in this place we found a small well of fresh water, supplied by a spring; and the day being now far spent, we returned to the ship. In the evening, Mr. Banks made a little excursion with his gun, and found such a number of quails, resembling those in England, that he might have shot as many as he pleased; but his object was variety and not number. The next morning, as the wind would not permit me to fail, I sent out several parties into the country to try again whether some intercourse could not be established with the natives. A midshipman who belonged to one of these parties having straggled a long way from his companions, met with a very old man and woman, and some little children ; they were sitting under a tree by the water side, and neither party saw the other till they were close together: the Indians showed signs of fear, but did not attempt to run away. The man happened to have nothing to give them but a parrot that he had shot; this he offered, but they refused to accept it, withdrawing themselves from his hand either through fear or aversion. His stay with them was but short, for he saw several canoes near the beach fishing, and being alone,, he feared they might come ashore and attack him : he said, that these people were very dark coloured, but not black; that the man and woman appeared to be very old, being both grey-headed ; that the hair of the man's head was bushy, and his beard long and rough; that the woman's hair was cropped short, and both of them were stark naked. Mr. Monkhouse the Surgeon, and one of the men, who were with another party near the watering-place, also strayed from their companions, and as they were coming out of a thicket observed six Indians standing together, at the distance of about fifty yards. One of them pronounced a word very 3 loud,"}, {"page_label": "Seite 99", "page_text": "ROUND THE WORLD. 99 loud, which was supposed to be a signal, for a lance was immediately thrown at him out of the wood, which very narrowly missed him. When the Indians saw that the weapon had not taken effect, they ran away with the greatest precipitation ; but on turning about towards the place whence the lance had been thrown, he saw a young Indian, whom he judged to be about nineteen or twenty years old, come down from a tree, and he also ran away with such speed as made it hopeless to follow him. Mr. Monkhoufe was of opinion that he had been watched by these Indians in his passage through the thicket, and that the youth had been stationed in the tree, to discharge the lance at him, upon a signal as he should come by; but however this be, there could be no doubt but that he was the person who threw the lance. In the afternoon, I went myself with a party over to the north shore, and while some of our people were hauling the seine, we made an excursion a few miles into the country, proceeding afterwards in the direction of the coast. We found this place without wood, and somewhat resembling our moors in England; the surface of the ground, however, was covered with a thin brush of plants, about as high as the knees: the hills near the coast are low, but others rife behind them, increasing by a gradual ascent to a considerable distance, with marshes and morasses between. When we returned to the boat, we found that our people had caught with the seine a great number of small fish, which are well known in the West Indies, and which our sailors call Leather jackets, because their skin is remarkably thick. I had sent the Second Lieutenant out in the yawl a striking, and when we got back to the ship, we found that he also had been very successful.

Wood indeed is every where plenty, but I saw only two kinds which may be considered as timber. These trees are as large, or larger than the English oak, and one of them has not a very different appearance: this is the same that yields the reddish gum like sanguis draconis , and the wood is heavy, hard, and dark-coloured, like lignum 'vita: the other grows tall and strait, something like the pine; and the wood of this, which has some resemblance to the live oak of America, is also hard and heavy. There are a few shrubs, and several kinds of the palm; mangroves also grow in great plenty near the head of the bay. The country in general is level, low, and woody, as far as we could fee. The woods, as I have before observed, abound with birds of exquisite beauty, particularly of the parrot kind; we found also crows here, exactly the fame with those in England. About the head of the harbour, where there are large flats of sand and mud, there is great plenty of water-fowl, most of which were altogether unknown to us one of the most remarkable was black and white, much; larger than a swan, and in shape somewhat resembling a pelican.

All the inhabitants that we saw were stark naked: they did not appear to be numerous, nor to live in societies, but like other animals were scattered about along the coast, and in the woods. Of their manner of life, however, we could know but little, as we were never able to form the least connection with them: after the first contest at our landing, they would never come near enough to parley; nor did they touch a single article of all that we had left at their huts, and the places they frequented, on purpose for them to take away. During my stay in this harbour, I caused the English colours to be displayed on shore every day, and the ship's name, and the date of the year, to be inscribed upon one of the trees near the watering-place.

E. till-eight o'clock, when having passed the breakers, and deepened our water to fifty-two fathom, we brought to till midnight, when we made fail again to the N. N. E. At four in the morning, we had 135 fathom, and when the day broke, I perceived that during the night I had got much farther northward, and from the shore, than I expected from the course we steered, for we were distant at least seven leagues ; I therefore hauled in N. W. by W. with a fiesta gale at S. S. W. The land that was farthest to the north the night before, now bore S. S. W. distant six leagues, and I gave it the name of Cape More- ton, it being the north point of Moreton's Bay : its latitude is 26° 56', and its longitude is 206° 28'. From Cape Moreton the land trends away west, farther than can be seen, for there is a small space, where at this time no land is visible, and some on board having also observed that the sea looked paler than usual, were of opinion that the bottom of Moreton's Bay opened into a river: we had here thirty-four fathom water, and a sine sandy bottom : this alone would have produced the change that had been observed in the colour of the water; and it was by no means necessary to suppose a river to account for the land at the bottom of the Bay not being visible, for supposing the land there to be as low as we knew it to be in a hundred other parts of the coast, it would have been impossible to fee it from the station of the ship; however, if any future navigator should be disposed to determine the question, whether there is or is not a river in this place, which the wind would not permit us to do, the situation may always be found by three hills which lie to the northward of it, in the latitude of 26° 53'. These hills lie but a little way inland, and not far from each other: they are remarkable for the singular form of their elevation, which"}, {"page_label": "Seite 111", "page_text": "ROUND THE WORLD. in which very much resembles a glass-house, and for which 1770. reason I called them the Glass Houses: the northermost of , May '_ , the three is the highest and largest: there are also several Thursda > ,, 7 . other peaked hills inland to the northward of these, but they are not nearly so remarkable. At noon, our latitude was, by observation, 26° 28'S. which was ten miles to the northward of the log, a circumstance which had never before happened upon this coast; our longitude was 206° 4 6 '. At this time we were between two and three leagues from the land, and had twenty-four fathom water. A low bluff point, which was the south head of a sandy bay, bore N. 62 W. distant three leagues, and the northermost point of land in sight bore N. 4 E. This day we saw smoke in several places, and some at a considerable distance inland. In steering along the shore at the distance of two leagues, our soundings were from twenty-four to thirty-two fathom, with a sandy bottom. At six in the evening, the northermost point of land bore N. q W. distant four leagues; at ten it bore N.W. by W. 7 W. and as we had seen no land to the northward of it, we brought to, not well knowing which way to steer.

In crossing this u.-^_' bay, our depth os -water was from thirty to twenty-two fa- Fnday 18. ^om, with a white sandy bottom. At noon, we were about three leagues from the shore, in latitude 25 0 34' S. longitude 206° 45'W.: Double Island Point bore S. 4.W. and the norther- most land in sight N. 1. E. This part of the coast, which is of a moderate height, is more barren than any we had seen, and the soil more sandy. With our glasses we could discover that the sands, which lay in great patches of many acres, were moveable, and that some of them had not been long in the place they possessed; for we saw in several parts, trees half buried, the tops of which were still green > and in others, the naked trunks of such as the sand had surrounded long enough to destroy. In other places the woods appeared to be low and shrubby, and we saw no signs of inhabitants. Two water snakes swam by the ship: they were beautifully spotted, and in every respect: like land snakes, except that their tails were broad and slat, probably to serve them instead of sins in swimming. In the morning of this day, the variation was 8°2o'E. and in the evening, 8° 36'. During the night, we continued our course to the northward, with a light breeze from the land, being distant from it between two and three leagues, and having from twenty-three to twenty-seven fathom, with a sine sandy bottom. Saturday 19. At noon on the 19th, we were about four miles from the land, with only thirteen fathom. Our latitude was 25 0 4', and the northermost land in sight bore N. 21 W. distant eight miles. At one o'clock, being still four miles distant from the shore, but having seventeen fathom water, we passed a black bluff head, or point of land, upon which a great number of the natives were assembled, and which therefore I called Indian Head : it lies in latitude 25 0 3'. About four miles N. by W. of this Head, is another very like it, from whence"}, {"page_label": "Seite 113", "page_text": "ROUND THE WORLD. whence the land trends away somewhat more to the westward : next to the sea it is low and sandy, and behind it nothing was to be seen, even from the mast-head. Near Indian Head we saw more of the natives, and upon the neighbouring shore sires by night, and smoke by day. We kept to the northward all night, at the distance of from four miles to four leagues from the shore, and with a depth of water from seventeen to thirty-four fathom. At day-break, the northermost land bore from us W. S. W. and seemed to end in a point, from which we discovered a reef running out to the northward as far as we could fee. We had hauled our wind to the westward before it was light, and continued the course till we saw the breakers upon our lee bow. We now edged away N. W. and N. N. W. along the east side of the shoal, from two to one mile distant, having regular soundings from thirteen to seven fathom, with a fine sandy bottom. At noon, our latitude, by observation, was 20° 26', which was thirteen miles to the northward of the log: we judged the extream point of the shoal to bear from us about N. W. and the point from which it seemed to run out, bore S. 4-W. distant twenty miles. This point I named Sandy Cape, from two very large patches of white sand which lay upon it. It is sufficiently high to be seen at the distance of twelve leagues, in clear weather, and lies in latitude 24 0 45', longitude 206° 51': the land trends from it S.W. as far as can be seen. We kept along the east side of the shoal till two in the afternoon, when, judging that there was a sufficient depth of water upon it to allow passage for the ship, I sent the boat a-head to sound, and upon her making the signal for more than five fathom, we hauled our wind, and stood over the tail of it in six fathom. At this time we were in latitude 24 0 22', and Sandy Cape bore S. 4 E. distant eight leagues ; but the direction of the shoal is nearest N, N. W. Vol. I1L P and n 3 1770. May.

Our latitude at this time was 24 0 28' 8 . For a few days past we had seen several of the sea birds called boobies, not having met with any of them before; last night a small stock of them pasted the ship, and went away to the N.

E. nor was one of them seen to fly in any other direction ; we therefore conjectured that there was a lagoon, river, or ' inlet of shallow water, in the bottom of the deep bay, to the southward of us, whither these birds resorted to feed in the day, and that not far to the northward there were some islands to which they repaired in the night.

We landed a little within the south point of the bay, where we found a channel leading into a large lagoon: this channel I proceeded to examine, and found three fathom water till I got about a mile up it, where I met with a Ihoal, upon which there was little more than one fathom, but having passed over it, I had three fathom again. The entrance of this channel lies close to the lbuth point of the bay, being formed by the shore on the east, and on the west by a large spit of sand: it is about a quarter of a mile broad, and lies in S. by W. In this place there is room for a few ships to lie in great security, / and a small stream of fresh water; I would have rowed into the lagoon, but was prevented by shallows. We found several bogs, and swamps of salt water, upon which, and by the sides of the lagoon, grows the true mangrove, such as is found in the West Indies, and the first of the kind that we had met with. In the branches of these mangroves there were many nests of a remarkable kind of ant, that was as green as grafs: when the branches were disturbed they came out in great numbers, and punished the offender by a much sharper bite than ever we had felt from the same kind of animal before. Upon these mangroves also we saw small green caterpillars in great numbers: their bodies were thick set with hairs, and they were ranged upon the leaves fide by side like a file of soldiers, to the number of twenty or thirty together: when we touched them, we found that the hair on their bodies had the quality of a nettle, and gave us a much more acute, though less durable pain. The country here is manifestly worse than about Botany Bay: the soil is dry and sandy, but the sides of the hills are covered with trees, which grow separately, without underwood.

We found also much less gum upon them, which is contrary to the established opinion, that the hotter the climate, the more gums exude. Upon a plant also, which yielded a yellow gum, there was less than upon the same kind of plant in Botany Bay. Among the shoals and sand-banks we saw many large birds, some in particular of the same kind that we had seen in Botany Bay, much bigger than swans, which we judged to be pelicans ; but they were so shy that we could not get within gun-shot of them. Upon the shore we saw a species of the bustard, one of which we shot, it was as large as a turkey, and weighed seventeen pounds and an half. We all agreed that this was the best bird we had eaten since we left England; and in honour of it we called this inlet Bustard Bay. It lies in latitude 24 0 4', longitude 208 0 18'. The sea seemed to abound with fish; but unhappily, we tore our seine all to pieces at the first haul: upon the mud-banks, under the mangroves, we found innumerable oysters of various kinds ; among others the hammer- oyster, and a large proportion of small pearl-oysters: if in deeper water there is equal plenty of such oysters at their full growth, a pearl fishery might certainly be established here to very great advantage. The people who were left on board the ship said, that while we were in the woods about twenty of the natives came down to the beach, abreast of her, and having looked at her sometime, went away; but we that were ashore, though we saw smoke in many places, saw no people: the smoke was at places too distant for us to get. to them by land, except one, to 1770. iVlay. >■ -- > Wednes. 23."}, {"page_label": "Seite 118", "page_text": "LIEUTENANT COOK's VOYAGE n8 177°.

We saw also, lying upon the ground, several pieces of soft bark, about the length and breadth of a man, which we imagined might be their beds ; and, on the windward side of the fires, a small shade, about a foot and a half high, of the fame substance. The whole was in a thicket of close trees, which afforded good shelter from the wind. The place seemed to be much trodden, and as we saw no house, nor any remains of a house, we were inclined to believe that as these people had no clothes, they had no dwelling; but spent their nights, among the other commoners of Nature, in the open air: and Tupia himself, with an air of superiority and compassion, shook his head, and said that they were Taata Enos, ' poor wretches.'

To this point I gave the name of Cape Manifold, from the number of high hills which appeared over it: it lies in latitude 22° 43' S. and distant about seventeen leagues from Cape Capricorn, in the direction of N. 26 W. Between these Capes the tit ore forms a large bay, which I called Keppel Bay ; and I also distinguished the islands by the name of Keppel's Islands. In this bay there is good anchorage ; but what refreshments it may afford, I know not: we caught no fish, though we were at anchor; but probably there is fresh water in several places, as both the islands and the main are inhabited. We saw smoke and fires upon the main ; and upon the islands we saw people. At three in the afternoon, we passed Cape Manifold, from which the land trends N. N. W. The land of the Cape is high, rising in hills directly from the sea ; and may be known by three islands which lie off it, one of them near the shore, and the other two eight miles out at sea.

It lies in latitude 22° 15'; longitude * 77 °- 209° 43': the land is high and level, and rather naked than <--_ woody. Several islands lie to the northward of it, at the dis- Monday tance of four or five miles out at sea; three or four leagues to the S. E. the shore forms a bay, in the bottom of which there appeared to be an inlet or harbour. To the westward of the Cape the land trends S. W. 7 S. and there forms a very large bay which turns to the eastward, and probably communicates with the inlet, and makes the land of the Cape an istand. As soon as we got round this Cape, we hauled our wind to the westward, in order to get within the istands, which lie scattered in the bay in great numbers, and extend out to sea as far as the eye could reach even from the mast-head: these istands vary both in height and circuit from each other; so that, although they are very numerous, no two of them are alike. We had not stood long upon a wind before we came into shoal water, and were obliged to tack at once to avoid it.

In the afternoon, having sounded round the ship, and found that there was water sufficient to carry her over the shoal, we weighed, and about three o'clock made sail and stood to the westward, as the land lay, having sent a boat ahead to found. At six in the evening, we anchored in ten fathom, with a sandy bottom, at about two miles distance from the main ; the westermost part of which bore W. N.

Tuesday 29, At five o'clock the next morning, I sent away the Master with two boats to found the entrance of an inlet which bore from us west, at about the distance of a league, into which I intended to go with the ship, that I might wait a few days till the moon should encrease, and in the mean time examine the country. As soon as the ship could be got under sail, the boats made the signal for anchorage; upon which we stood in, and anchored in five fathom water, about a league within the entrance of the inlet; which, as I observed a tide to slow and ebb considerably, I judged to be a river that ran up the country to a considerable distance. In this place I had thoughts of laying the ship ashore, and cleaning her bottom; I therefore landed with the Master in search of a convenient place for that purpose, and was accompanied by Mr. Banks andDr.Solander. We found walking here exceedingly troublesome, for the ground was covered with a kind of grafs, the feeds of which were very sharp and bearded backwards ; so that whenever they stuck into our clothes, which indeed was at every step, they worked forwards by means of the beard, till they got at the flesh; and at the same time we were surrounded by a cloud of musquitos, which incessantly tor- 5 mented"}, {"page_label": "Seite 125", "page_text": "ROUND THE WORLD. i 2 5 mented us with their stings.

We proceeded however up the country, where we found gum trees like those that we had seen before, and observed that here also the gum was in very small quantities. Upon the branches of these trees, and some others, we found ants nests, made of clay, as big as a bushel, something like those described in Sir Hans Sloan's Natural History of Jamaica, vol. ii. p. 221, tab. 258, but not so smooth : the ants which inhabited these nests were small, and their bodies white. But upon another species of the tree we found a small black ant, which perforated all the twigs, and having worked out the pith, occupied the pipe which had contained it; yet the parts in which these insects had thus formed a lodgment, and in which they swarmed in amazing numbers* bore leaves and flowers, and appeared to be in as flourishing; a state as those that were sound. We found also an incredible number of butterflies, so that for the space of three or four acres the air was so crowded with them that millions- were to be seen in every direction, at the same time that every branch and twig was covered with others that were not upon the wing. We found here also a small fish of a singular kind; it was about the size of a minnow, and had two very strong breast fins: we found it in places that were quite dry, where we supposed it might have been left by the tide; but it did not seem to have become languid by the want of water; for upon our approach it leaped away, by the help of the breast fins, as nimbly as a frog: neither indeed did it seem to prefer water to land; for when we found it in the water, it frequently leaped out, and pursued its way- upon dry ground: we also observed that when it was in places where small stones were standing above the surface of"}, {"page_label": "Seite 126", "page_text": "jz6 LIEUTENANT COOK's VOYAGE > 770. of the water at a little distance from each other, it chose ra- May. r--, ther to leap from stone to stone, than to pass through the Tue.day 29. a nd we f aw several of them pass entirely over puddles in this manner, till they came to dry ground, and then leap away. In the afternoon we renewed our search after fresh water, but without success; and therefore I determined to make my stay here but short: however, having observed from an eminence that the inlet penetrated a considerable way into the country, I determined to trace it in the morning. Wednes. 30. At fun-rife I went ashore, and climbing a considerable hill, I took a view of the coast and the islands that lie off it, with their bearings, having an azimuth compass with me for that purpose; but I observed that the needle differed very considerably in its position, even to thirty degrees, in some places more, in others less; and once I found it differ from itself no less than two points in the distance of fourteen feet. I took up some of the loose stones that lay upon the ground, and applied them to the needle, but they produced no effect ; and I therefore concluded that there was iron ore in the hills, of which I had remarked other indications both here, and in the neighbouring parts. After I had made my observations upon the hill, I proceeded with Dr. Solander up the inlet; I set out with the first of the stood, and long before higli- water I had advanced above eight leagues. Its breadth thus far was from two to five miles, upon a 8. W. by S. direction ; but here it opened every way, and formed a large lake, which to the N. W. communicated with the sea; and I not only saw the sea in this direction, but found the tide of stood coming strongly in from that point: I also observed an arm of this lake extending to the eastward, and it is not improbable that it may communicate with the sea in the bottom"}, {"page_label": "Seite 127", "page_text": "ROUND THE WORLD. 127 com of the bay, which lies to the westward of Gape Town- fhend. On the south side of the lake is a ridge of high hills which I was very desirous to climb; but it being high-water, and the day far spent, I was afraid of being bewildered among the shoals in the night, especially as the weather was dark and rainy; and therefore I made the best of my way to the ship. In this excursion I saw only two people, and they were at a distance; they followed the boat along the shore a good way, but the tide running strongly in my favour I could not prudently wait for them : I saw however several sires in one direction, and smoke in another, but they also were at a distance. While I was tracing the inlet with Dr. Solander, Mr. Banks was endeavouring to penetrate into the country, where several of the people who had leave to go ashore were also rambling about. Mr. Banks and his party found their course obstructed by a swamp, covered with mangroves, which however they resolved to pass ; the mud was almost knee deep, yet they resolutely went on ; but before they got half way, they repented of their undertaking: the bottom was covered with branches of trees interwoven with each other, sometimes they kept their footing upon them, sometimes their feet stipt through, and sometimes they were so entangled among them, that they were forced to free themselves by groping in the mud and slime with their hands. In about an hour however they crossed it, and judged it might be about a quarter of a mile over. After a short walk they came up to a place where there had been four small sires, and near them some shells and bones of sub, that had been roasted: they found also heaps of grafs laid together, where four or five people appeared to have slept. The Second Lieutenant, Mr. Gore, who was at another place, saw a little water lying in the bottom of a gully, and near it the track o-f a large animal: some bustards were also seen, but none 1770.

Mr. Gore, and one of the midshipmen, who were in different places, said that they had heard the voices of Indians near them, but had seen none: the country in general appeared sandy and barren, and being destitute of fresh water, it cannot be supposed to have any settled inhabitants. The deep gullies, which were worn by torrents from the hills, prove, that at certain seasons the rains here are very copious and heavy. The inlet in which the ship lay I called Thirsty Sound, because it afforded us no fresh water. It lies in latitude 220 10'S. and longitude 210 0 18'W.; and may be known by a group of small islands lying under the shore, from two to five leagues distant, in the direction of N. W. and by another group of islands that lie right before it, between three and four leagues out at sea. Over each of the points that form the entrance is a high round hill, which on the N. W. is a peninsula that at high-water is surrounded by the sea: they are bold to both the shores, and the distance between them is about two miles. In this inlet is good anchorage in seven, fix, five, and four fathom ; and places very convenient for laying a ship down, where, at spring-tides, the water does not rife less than sixteen or eighteen feet. The tide stows at the full and change of the moon about eleven o'clock. I have already observed that here is no fresh water, nor could we procure refreshment of any other kind: we saw two turtles, but we were not able to take either of them : neither did we eatch either fish or wild-fowl, except a few small land-birds: we saw indeed the same sorts of water-fowl as in Botany Bay, but they were so shy that we could not get a shot at them.

At noon, the west point of Thirsty Sound, which I have called Pier Head, bore 8.36 E. distant five leagues; the east point of the other inlet, which communicates with the Sound, bore S. by W. distant two leagues; the group of islands just mentioned lay between us and the point, and the farthest part of the main in sight, on the other side of the inlet, bore N.

At eight in the evening, being about two leagues from the main land, we anchored in eleven fathom, with a sandy bottom; and soon after we found the tide setting with a slow motion to the westward.

We now got under sail, and stood away in the direction of the coast, N. N.W. From what we had observed of the tide during the night, it is plain, that the flood came from the N.W.; whereas the preceding day, and several days before, it came from the S.

At noon we were about two leagues from the main, and four from the islands without us. Our latitude by observation was 20 0 56', and a high promontory, which I named Cape Hillsborough, bore W. 4 N. distant seven miles. The land here is diversified by mountains, hills, plains, and valleys, and seems to be well clothed with herbage and wood: the islands which lie parallel to the coast, and from five to eight or nine miles distant, are of various height and extent; scarcely any of them are more than five leagues in circumference, and many are not four miles: besides this chain of islands, which lies at a distance from the coast, there are others much less, which lie under the land, from which we saw smoke rising in different places. We continued to steer along the shore at the distance of about two leagues, with regular soundings from nine to ten fathom. At fun-set, the farthest point of the main bore N. 48 W. and to the northward of this lay some high land, which I took to be an island, and of which the north west point bore 41 W.; but not being sure of a passage, I came to an anchor about eight o'clock in the evening, in ten fathom water, with a muddy bottom.

The greatest depth of water which we found in it was thirteen fathom, and the least eight.. In all parts there was safe anchorage, and I believe, that upon proper examination, some good harbours would be found in it; especially at the north fide within Cape Conway; for just within that Cape there lie two or three small islands, which alone would shelter that side of the bay from the southerly and south easterly winds, that seem to prevail here as a Trade. Among the many islands that lie upon this coast, there is one more remarkable than the rest j it is of a small circuit, very high and peaked, and lies E. by S. ten miles from Cape Conway, at the south end of the passage. In the afternoon, we steered through this passage, which we found to be from three to seven miles broad, and eight or nine leagues in length, N. by W. 4 W., S. by E. 4 E. It is formed by the main on the west, and by the islands on the east, one of which is at least five leagues in length: our depth of water in running through was from twenty to five and twenty fathom, with good anchorage every where, and the whole passage may be considered as one safe harbour, exclusive of the small bays and coves which abound on each side, 7"}, {"page_label": "Seite 133", "page_text": "ROUND THE WORLD. *3; side, where ships might lie as in a bason. The land both 177°* upon the main and islands is high, and diversified by hill and valley, wood and lawn, with a green and pleasant appearance. On one of the islands we discovered with our glasses two men and a woman, and a canoe with an outrigger, which appeared to be larger, and of a construction very different from those of bark tied together at the ends, which we had seen upon other parts of the coast ; we hoped therefore that the people here had made some farther advances beyond mere animal life than those that we had seen before. At six o'clock in the evening, we were nearly the length of the north end of the passage; the north westermost point of the main in sight bore N. 54 W. and the north end' of the island N. N. E. with an open sea between the two points. As this paslage was discovered on Whitsunday, I called it Whitsunday's Passage, and I called the islands that form it Cumberland Islands, in honour of his Royal Highness the Duke. We kept under an easy sail, with the lead going all night, being at the distance of about three leagues from the shore, and having from twenty-one to twenty-threc fathom water.

On the west side of Cape Gloucester the land trends away S.

At noon, we were about three leagues from the shore, by observation in latitude 19 0 47' 8. and Cape Gloucester bore 8. 63 E. distant seven leagues and an half. At six in the evening, we were abreast of the westernmost point just mentioned, at about three miles distance, and because it rises abruptly from the low lands which surround it, I called it Cape Upstart. It lies in latitude ig Q 39' S., longitude 212 0 32' W. fourteen leagues W.N. W. from Cape Gloucester, and is of a height sufficient to be seen at the distance of twelve leagues: inland there are some high hills or mountains, which, like the Cape, afford but a barren prospect. Having passed this Cape, we continued standing to the W. N.W. as the land lay, under an easy sail, having from sixteen to ten fathom, till two o'clock in the morning, when we fell into seven fathom; upon which we hauled our wind to the northward, judging ourselves to be very near land: at day-break, we found our conjecture to be true, being within little more than two leagues of it. In this part of the coast the land, being very low, is nearer than it appears to be, though it is diversified with here and there a hill. At noon, we were about four leagues from the land, in fifteen fathom water, and our latitude, by observation, was 19 0 12' 8. Cape Upstart bearing S. 32 0 30' E. distant twelve leagues. About this time some very large columns of smoke were seen rising from the low lands. At fun-fet, the preceding night, when we were close under Cape Upstart, the variation was nearly 9 0 E. and at sun-rise this day, it was no more than 5 0 35'; I judged therefore that it had been influenced by iron ore, or other magnetical matter, contained under the surface of the earth. 1 We"}, {"page_label": "Seite 135", "page_text": "ROUND THE WORLD. 135 We continued to steer W.

This bay, which I named Cleaveland Bay, appeared to be about five or six miles in extent every way: the east point I named Cape Cleaveland, and the west, which had the appearance of an island, Magnetical Isle, as we perceived that the compass did not traverse well when we were near it: they are both high, and so is the main land within them, the whole forming a surface the most rugged, rocky, and barren of any we had seen upon the coast ; it was not however without inhabitants, for we saw smoke in several parts of the bottom of the bay. The northermost land that was in sight at this time, bore N.W. and it had the appearance of an island, for we could not trace the main land farther than W. by N. We steered W.

About seven o'clock in the evening they returned, with an account that what we had taken for cocoa- nut trees, were a small kind of cabbage palm, and that, except about fourteen or fifteen plants, they had met with nothing worth bringing away. While they were ashore, they saw none of the people, but just as they had put off, one of them came very near the beach, and shouted with a loud voice; it was so dark that they could not fee him, however they turned towards the shore, but when he heard the boat putting back, he ran away or hid himself, for they could not get a glimpse of him, and though they shouted he made no reply.

Cape Sandwich may be known not only by the high craggy land over it, but by a small istand which lies east of it, at the distance of a mile, and some others that lie about two leagues to the northward. From Cape Sandwich the land trends W. and afterwards N. forming a fine large bay, which I called Rockingham Bay, where there appears to be good shelter, and good anchorage, but I did not stay to examine it: I kept ranging along the shore to the northward, for a cluster of small islands, which lie off the northern point of the Bay. Between the three outermost of these islands, and those near the shore, I found a channel of about a mile broad, through which I passed, and upon one of the nearest islands we saw with our glasses about thirty of the natives, men, women, and children, all standing together, and looking with great attention at the strip; the first instance of curiosity that we had seen among them: they were all stark naked, with short hair, and of the same complexion with those that we had seen before.

The most distant point in sight to the northward bore N. by \\V. 4 W. and we thought it was part of the main, but afterwards found it to be an istand of considerable height, and about four miles in circuit. Between this istand and a point on the main, from which it is distant about two miles, I passed with the ship. At noon, we were in the middle of the channel, and by observation in the latitude of i6° 57' S. with twenty fathom water. The point on the main, of which we were now abreast, I called Cape Graeton: its latitude is 16 0 57'S. and longitude 214° 6'W. and the land here, as well as the whole coast for about twenty leagues to the southward, is high, has a rocky surface, and is thinly covered with wood: during the night we had seen several sires, and about noon some people.

When we got ashore, we found the country every where rising into steep rocky hills, and as no fresh water could conveniently be procured, I was unwilling to lose time by going in search of lower land elsewhere: we therefore made the best of our way back to the sihip, and about midnight we weighed and stood to the N.

In a few moments every body was upon the deck, with countenances which sufficiently expressed the horrors of our situation, We had stood off the shore three hours and a half, with a pleasant breeze, and therefore knew that we could not be very near it, and we had too much reason to conclude that we were upon a rock of coral, which is more fatal than any other, because the points of it are sharp, and every part of the surface so rough as to grind away whatever is rubbed against it, even with the gentlest motion.

The ship lay with her head to the N. E.; and at the distance of about thirty yards on the starboard side, the water deepened to eight, ten, and twelve fathom. As soon as the long-boat was out, we struck our yards and top masts, and carried out the stream anchor on the starboard bow, got the coasting anchor and cable into the boat, and were going to carry it out the fame way; but upon sounding a second time round the strip, the water was found to be deepest astern: the anchor therefore was carried out from the starboard quarter instead of the starboard bow, that is, from the stern instead of the head, and having taken ground, our utmost force was applied to the capstern, hoping that if the anchor did not come home, the strip would be got off, but to our great misfortune and disappointment we could not move her: during all this time she continued to beat with great violence against the rock, so that it was with the utmost difficulty that we kept upon our legs; and to complete the scene of distress, we saw by the light of the moon the sheathing boards from the bottom of the vessel floating away all round her, and at last her false keel, so that every moment was making way for the sea to ruslr in which was to swallow us up.

At two o'clock, she lay heeling two or three streaks to starboard, and the pinnace, which lay under her bows, touched the ground: we had now no hope but from the tide at midnight, and to prepare for it we carried out our two bower anchors, one on the starboard quarter, and the other right a-stern, got the blocks and tackle which were to give us a purchase upon the cables in order, and brought the falls, or ends of them, in abaft, straining them tight, that the next effort might operate upon the ship, and by shortening the length of the cable between that and the anchors, draw her off the ledge upon which she rested, towards the deep water. About five o'clock in the afternoon, we observed the tide begin to rise, but we observed at the same time that the leak increased to a most alarming degree, so that two more pumps were manned, but unhappily only one of them would work: three of the pumps however were kept going, and at nine o'clock the ship righted, but the leak had gained upon us so considerably, that it was imagined she must go to the bottom as soon as she ceased to be supported by the rockthis was a dreadful circumstance, so that we anticipated the floating of the ship not as an earnest of deliverance, but as an event that would probably precipitate our destruction. We well knew that our boats were not capable of carrying us all on shore, and that when the dreadful crisis should arrive, as all command and subordination would be at an end, a contest for preference would probably ensue, that would increase the horrors even of shipwreck, and terminate in the destruction of us all by the hands of each other; yet we knew that if any should be left on board to perish in the waves, they would probably suffer less upon the whole than those who 2 should"}, {"page_label": "Seite 145", "page_text": "ROUND THE WORLD. should get on shore, without any lasting or effectual defence 177°* • \" 1 r June; against the natives, in a country, where even nets and tire- \" arms would scarcely furnish them with food ; and where, if w,day they should find the means of subsistence, they must be condemned to languish out the remainder of life in a desolate wilderness, without the posiefsion, or even hope, of any domestic comfort, and cut off from all commerce with mankind, except the naked savages who prowled the desert, and who perhaps were some of the most rude and uncivilized upon the earth. To those only who have waited in a state of such suspense, death has approached in all his terrors ; and as the dreadful moment that was to determine our fate came on, every one saw his own sensations pictured in the countenances of his companions: however, the capstan and windlace were manned with as many hands as could be spared from the pumps, and the ship floating about twenty minutes after ten o'clock, the effort was made, and she was heaved into deep water. It was some comfort to find that she did not now admit more water than she had done upon the rock; and though, by the gaining of the leak upon the pumps, there was no less than three feet nine inches water in the hold, yet the men did not relinquish their labour, and we held the water as it were at bay ; but having now endured excessive fatigue of body and agitation of mind for more than four and twenty hours, and having but little hope of succeeding at last, they began to stag: none of them could work at the pump more than five or six minutes together, and then, being totally exhausted, they threw themselves down upon the deck, though a stream • of water was running over it from the pumps between three and four inches deep; when those who succeeded them had worked their spell, and were exhausted in their turn, they threw themselves down in the same manner, and the others Vol. III.

The planking which lines the inside of the ship's bottom is called the deling, and between this, and the outside planking, there is a space of about eighteen inches : the man who till this time had attended the well to take the depth of water, had taken it only to the deling, and gave the mealure accordingly; but he being now relieved, the person who came in his stead, reckoned the depth to the outside planking, by which it appeared in a few minutes to have gained upon the pumps eighteen inches, the difference between the planking without and within. Upon this, even the bravest was upon the point of giving up his labour with his hope, and in a few minutes every thing would have been involved in all the confusion of despair. But this accident, however dreadful in its first consequences, was eventually the cause of our preservation: the mistake was soon detected, and the sudden joy which every man felt upon finding his situation better than his fears had suggested, operated like a charm, and seemed to possess him with a strong belief that scarcely any real danger remained. New confidence and new hope, however founded, inspired new vigour; and though our state was the same as when the men first began to slacken in their labour, through weariness and despondency, they now renewed their efforts with such alacrity and spirit, that before eight o'clock in the morning the leak was so far from having gained upon the pumps, that the pumps had gained considerably upon the leak. Every body now talked of getting the lhip into some harbour, as a thing not to be doubted, and as hands could be spared from the pumps, they were employed in getting up the anchors: the stream anchor and best bower we had taken on board; but it was found impossible to lave the little bower, and therefore it was"}, {"page_label": "Seite 147", "page_text": "ROUND THE WORLD. 147 was cut away at a whole cable: we lost also the cable of the 1770. stream anchor among the rocks; but in our situation these were trifles which scarcely attracted our notice. Our next business was to get up the fore-topmast, and fore-yard, and warp the ship to the southeast, and at eleven, having now a breeze from the sea, we once more got under sail and stood for the land. It was however impossible long to continue the labour by which the pumps had been made to gain upon the leak, and as the exact situation of it could not be discovered, we had no hope of stopping it within. In this situation, Mr, Monkhouse, Tuesday 12. one of my midshipmen, came to me and proposed an expedient that he had once seen used on board a merchant ship, which sprung a leak that admitted above four feet water an hour, and which by this expedient was brought safely from Virginia to London; the master having such confidence in it, that he took her out of harbour, knowing her condition, and did not think it worth while to wait till the leak could be otherwise stopped. To this man, therefore, the care of the expedient, which is called fothering the ship, was immediately committed, four or five of the people being appointed to assist him, and he performed it in this manner: He took a lower studding fail, and having mixed together a large quantity of oakham and wool, chopped pretty small, he stitched it down in handfuls upon the fail, as lightly as possible, and over this he spread the dung of our sheep and other filth; but horse dung, if we had had it, would have been better. When the sail was thus prepared, it was hauled under the ship's bottom by ropes, which kept it extended, and when it came under the leak, the suction which carried in the water, carried in with it the oakham and wool from the surface of the sail, which in other parts the water was T 2 not"}, {"page_label": "Seite 148", "page_text": "148 LIEUTENANT COOK's VOYAGE 1770. not sufficiently agitated to wash off. By the success of this .r expedient our leak was so far reduced, that instead of gain- 1 oesday 1 z. U p Gn t ] irce pumps, it was easily kept under with one. This was a new source of confidence and comfort; the people could scarcely have expressed more joy if they had been already in port; and their views were so far from being limited to running the ship ashore in some harbour, either of an island or the main, and building a vessel out of her materials to carry us to the East Indies, which had so lately been the utmost object of our hope, that nothing was now thought of but ranging along the shore in search of a convenient place to repair the damage she had sustained, and then prosecuting the voyage upon the same plan as if nothing had happened. Upon this occasion I must observe, both in justice and gratitude to the ship's company, and the Gentlemen on board, that although in the midst of our distress every one seemed to have a just sense of his danger, yet no passionate exclamations, or frantic gestures, were to be heard or seen; every one appeared to have the perfect possession of his mind, and every one exerted himself to the uttermost, with a quiet and patient perseverance, equally distant from the tumultuous violence of terror, and the gloomy inactivity of despair. In the mean time, having light airs at E. S. E. we got up the main-topmast, and main-yard, and kept edging in for the land, till about fix o'clock in the evening, when we came to an anchor in seventeen fathom water, at the distance of seven leagues from the shore, and one from the ledge of rocks upon which we had struck. This ledge or shoal lies in latitude 15 0 4/ 8. and between six and seven leagues from the main. It is not however the only shoal on this part of the coast, especially to the northward;"}, {"page_label": "Seite 149", "page_text": "ROUND THE WORLD.

A part of this shoal Tuekjay I2 * is always above water, and has the appearance of white sand: a part also of that upon which we had lain is dry at low water, and in that place consists of sand stones ; but all the rest of it is a coral rock. While we lay at anchor for the night, we found that the ship made about fifteen inches water an hour, from which no immediate danger was to be apprehended ; and at six o'clock in the morning, we weighed and stood to the N.W. Wednes - L 3- still edging in for the land with a gentle breeze at S.S.E. At nine we pasted close without two small islands that lie in latitude 15 0 41' S. and about four leagues from the main: to reach these islands had, in the height of our distress, been the object; of our hope, or perhaps rather of our wishes, and therefore I called them Hope Islands. At noon we were about three leagues from the land, and in latitude 15 0 37' S.; the northermost part of the main in sight bore N. 30 W.; and Hope Islands extended from S. 30 E. to S. 40 E. In this situation we had twelve fathom water, and several sand-banks without us. At this time the leak had not increased; but that we might be prepared for all events, we got the fail ready for another fothering. In the afternoon, having a gentle breeze at S.E. by E. I sent out the Master with two boats, as well to found ahead of the ship, as to look out for a harbour where we might repair our defects, and put the ship in a proper trim. At three o'clock, we saw an opening that had the appearance of an harbour, and stood off and on while the boats examined it; but they soon found that there was not depth of water in it sufficient for the ship.

Tn consequence of this information, I weighed at six o'clock Thursday 14. in the morning, and having sent two boats ahead, to lie upon the shoals that we saw in our way, we ran down to the place; but notwithstanding our precaution, we were once in three fathom water. As soon as these shoals were passed, I sent the boats to lie in the channel that led to the harbour, and by this time it began to blow. It was happy for us that a place of refuge was at hand ; for we soon found that the ship would not work, having twice missed stays: our situation, however, though it might have been much worse, was not without danger; we were entangled among shoals, and I had great reason to fear being driven to leeward, before the boats could place themselves so as to prescribe our course. I therefore anchored in four fathom, about a mile from the shore, and then made the signal for the boats to come on board. When this was done I went myself and buoyed the channel, which I found very narrow ; the harbour also I found smaller than I expected, but most excellently adapted to our purpose; and it is remarkable, that in the whole course of our voyage we had seen no place which, in our present circumstances, could have afforded us the fame relief. At noon, our latitude was 15 0 26' 8.

The gale continuing, we kept our station all the 15th. On the Friday 15. 16th, it was somewhat more moderate ; and about six o'clock Saturday ,6. in the morning, we hove the cable short, with a design to get under fail, but were obliged to desist, and veer it out again. It is remarkable that the sea breeze, which blew fresh when we anchored, continued to do so almost every day while we stayed here ; it was calm only while we were upon the rock, except once; and even the gale that afterwards wafted us to the shore, would then certainly have beaten us to pieces. In the evening of the preceding day, we had observed a fire near the beach over against us ; and as it would be necessary for us to stay sometime in this place, we were not without hope of making an acquaintance with the people. We saw more fires upon the hills to-day, and with our glasses discovered four Indians going along the shore, who stopped, and made two fires; but for what purpose it was impossible we should guess. The scurvy now began to make its appearance among us, with many formidable symptoms..

We now got down the fore yard, fore topmasts, and booms, and taking them overboard, made a raft of them alongside of the ship.

We also landed all the empty water calks, and part of the stores. As soon as the tent for the sick was got ready for their reception, they were sent ashore to the number of eight or nine, and the boat was dispatched to haul the seine, in hopes of procuring some fish for their refreshment; but she returned without success. In the mean time, I climbed one of the highest hills among those that overlooked the harbour, which afforded by no means a comfortable prospect;: the low land near the river is wholly over-run with mangroves, among which the salt-water stows every tide ; and the high land appeared to be every where stoney and barren. In the mean time Mr. Banks had also taken a walk up the country, and met with the frames of several old Indian houses, and places where they had dressed shell-fish ; but they seemed not to have been frequented for some months.

In the afternoon, all the officers' stores and the ground tier of water were got out; so that nothing remained in the fore and main hold, but the coals, and a small quantity of stone ballast. This day Mr. Banks crossed the river to take a view of the country on the other -side: he found it consist principally of sand-hills, where he saw some Indian houses, which appeared to have been very lately inhabited.

On the 20th, we landed the powder, and got out the stone ballast and wood, which brought the ship's draught of water to eight feet ten inches forward, and thirteen feet abaft; and this I thought, with the difference that would be made by trimming the coals aft, would be sufficient; for I found that the water rose and fell perpendicularly eight feet at the spring-tides: but as soon as the coals were trimmed from over the leak, we could hear the water rush in a little abaft' the foremast, about three feet from the keel: this determined me to clear the hold intirely. This evening, Mr. Banks observed that in many parts of the inlet there were large quantities of pumice stones, which lay at a considerable distance above high-water mark ; whither they might have been carried either by the freshes or extraordinary high tides, for there could be no doubt but that they came from the sea.

Her draught of water forward was now seven feet nine inches, and abaft thirteen feet six inches. At eight o'clock, it being high- water, I hauled her bow close ashore; but kept her stern afloat, because I was afraid of neiping her; it was however necessary to lay the whole of her as near the ground as possible. At two o'clock in the morning of the zid, the tide left her, Friday aa. and gave us an opportunity to examine the leak, which we found to be at her floor heads, a little before the starboard fore-chains. In this place the rocks had made their way through four planks, and even into the timbers; three more planks were much damaged, and the appearance of these breaches was very extraordinary: there was not a splinter to be seen, but all was as smooth, as if the whole had been cut away by an instrument: the timbers in this place were happily very close, and if they had not, it would have been absolutely impossible to have saved the ship. But after all, her preservation depended upon a circumstance still more remarkable: in one of the holes, which was big enough to have funk us, if we had had eight pumps instead of four, and been able to keep them incessantly going, was in great measure plugged up by a fragment of the rock, which, after having made the wound, was left sticking in it; so that the water which at first had gained upon our pumps, was what came in at the interstices, between the stone and the edges of the hole that received it. We found also several pieces of the fothering, which had made their way between the U 2 timbers,"}, {"page_label": "Seite 156", "page_text": "LIEUTENANT COOK'S VOYAGE 1770. June. Friday zz.

Upon further examination, we found that, besides the leak, considerable damage had been done to the bottom ; great part of the sheathing was gone from under the larboard bow; a considerable part of the false keel was also wanting, and these indeed we had seen swim away in fragments from the vessel, while she lay beating against the rock:, the remainder of it was info shattered a condition that it had better have been gone, and the fore foot and main keel were also damaged, but not so as to produce any immediate danger: what damage she might have received abaft could not yet be exactly known, but we had reason to think it was not much, as but little water made its way into her bottom, while the tide kept below the leak which has already been described. By nine o'clock in the morning the carpenters got to work upon her, while the smiths were busy in making bolts and nails. In the mean time, some of the people were sent on the other side of the water to shoot pigeons for the sick, who at their return reported that they had seen an animal as large as a greyhound, of a slender make, a mouse colour, and extremely swift; they discovered also many Indian houses, and a fine stream of fresh water. The next morning, I sent a boat to haul the seine ; but at noon it returned with only three fish, and yet we saw them in plenty leaping about the harbour. This day the carpenter finished the repairs that were necessary on the starboard side; and at nine o'clock in the evening, we heeled the ship the other way, and hauled her off about two feet for fear of neiping. This day almost every body had seen the animal which the pigeon-lhooters had brought an account of the day before ; and one of the seamen, who had been rambling in the woods, told us at his return, that he verily believed he"}, {"page_label": "Seite 157", "page_text": "ROUND THE WORLD. rZ7 he had seen the devil : we naturally enquired in what form 1770. he had appeared, and his answer was in so singular a stile .

Early on the 24th, the carpenters began to repair the Sunday 24, sheathing under the larboard bow, where we found two planks cut about half through; and'in the mean time I sent a party of men, under the direction of Mr. Gore, in search of refreshments for the sick: this party returned about noon- with a few palm cabbages, and a bunch or two of wild plantain ; the plantains were the smallest I had ever seen, and the pulp, though it was well tasted, was full of small stones.

After the ship was hauled ashore, all the water that came into her of course went backwards ; so that although she was Sunday Z4. forward, flie had nine feet water abaft: as in this part therefore her bottom could not be examined on the inside, I took the advantage of the tide being out this evening to get the master and two of the men to go under her, and examine her whole larboard side without. They found the sheathing gone about the floor heads abreast of the mainmast, and part of a plank a little damaged ; but all agreed that flie had received no other material injury. The loss of her sheathing alone was a great misfortune, as the worm would now be let into her bottom, which might expose us to great inconvenience and danger; but as I knew no remedy for the mischief but heaving her down, which would be a work of immense labour and long time, if practicable at all in our present situation, I was obliged to be content. The carpenters however continued to work under her bottom in the evening till they were prevented by the tide; the morning tide did not ebb out far enough to permit them to work at all, for we had only one tolerable high and low tide in four and twenty hours, as indeed we had experienced when we lay upon the rock. The position of the ship, which threw the water in her abaft, was very near depriving the world of all the knowlege which Mr. Banks had endured so much labour, and so many risks, to procure; for he had removed the curious collection of plants which he made during the whole voyage, into the bread room, which lies in the after part of the ship, as a place of the greatest security ; and nobody having thought of the danger to which laying her head so much higher than the stern would expose them, they were this day found under water.

On the 28th, Mr. Banks went with some of the seamen up the country, to shew them the plant which in the West Indies is called Indian kale, and which served us for greens. Tu* pia had much meliorated the root of the coccos, by giving them a long chesting in his country oven, but they were so small that we did not think them an object for the strip. In their walk they found one tree which had been notched for the convenience of climbing it, in the same manner with those we had seen in Botany Bay: they saw also many nests of white ants, which resemble those of the East Indies, the most pernicious insects in the world. The nests were of a pyramidical figure, from a few inches to six feet high, and very much resembled the stones in England, which are said to be monuments of the Druids. Mr. Gore, who was also this day four or five miles up the country, reported that he had seen the footsteps of men, and tracked animals of three or four different forts, but had not been fortunate enough to fee either man or beast. At two o'clock in the morning of the 29th, I observed, in conjunction with Mr. Green, an emersion of Jupiter's first satellite; the time here was 2 h 18' 53\", which gave the longitude of this place 214 0 42' zo\" W.: its latitude is 15 0 26'S, At break of day, I sent the boat out again with the seine, and in the afternoon, it returned with as much fish as enabled me to give every man a pound and an half.

The next morning, encouraged by the success of the day before, I sent the boat again to haul the seine, and another party to gather greens : I sent also some of the young gentlemen to take a plan of the harbour, and went myself upon a hill, which lies over the south point, to take a view of the sea. At this time it was low water, and I saw, with great concern, innumerable sand banks and shoals lying all along the coast in every direction. The innermost lay about three or four miles from the shore, the outermost extended as far as I could fee with my glass, and many of them did but just rife above water. There was some appearance of a passage to the northward, and I had no hope of getting clear but in that direction, for as the wind blows constantly from the 8.

Mr. Gore reported, that he had this day seen two animals like dogs, of a straw colour, that they ran like a hare, and were about the same size. In the afternoon, the people returned from hauling the seine, with still better success than before, for I was now able to distribute two pounds and an half to each man : the greens that had been gathered I ordered to be boiled among the peas, and they made an excellent mess, which, with two copious supplies of fish, afforded us unspeakable refreshment. The next day, July the ist, being Sunday, everybody had liberty to go ashore, except one from each mess, who were again sent out with the seine. The seine was again equally successful, and the people who went up the country gave an account of having seen several animals, though none of them were to be caught.

This day the thermometer in the shade rose to 87, which was higher than it had been on any day, since we came upon this coast. Early the next morning, I sent the Master in the pinnace, out of the harbour, to sound about the shoals in the offing,, and look for a channel to the northward: at this time we had a breeze from the land, which continued till about nine o'clock, and was the first we had had since our coming into the river. At low water we lashed some empty calks under the lhip's bows, having some hope that as the tides were rising ffie would float the next high water. We still continued to fish with great success, and at high water we again attempted to heave the ship off, but our utmost efforts were still ineffectual. The next day at noon, the Master returned, and reported, that he had found a passage out to sea between the shoals, and described its situation. The shoals, he said, consisted of coral rocks, many of which were dry at low water, and upon one of which he had been ashore. He found here some cockles of so enormous a size that one of them was more than two men could eat, and a great variety of other shellfish, of which he brought us a plentiful supply: in the evening, he had also landed in a bay about three leagues to the northward of our station, where he disturbed some of the natives who were at supper: they all fled with the greatest precipitation at his approach, leaving some fresh sea eggs, and a fire ready kindled behind them, but there was neither house"}, {"page_label": "Seite 163", "page_text": "HOUND THE WORLD. 163 house nor hovel near the place. We observed, that although *770. the shoals that lie just within sight of the coast, abound with <--* shell-fish, which may be easily caught at low water; yet we Tuesday 3 \" saw no such shells about the sire places on shore. This day an allegator was seen to swim about the ship for some time, and at high water we made another effort to stoat her, which happily succeeded * we found however that by lying so long with her head a-ground, and her stern a-fioat, she had sprung a plank between decks, a-breast of the main chains, so that it was become necessary to lay her ashore again. The next morning was employed in trimming her upon Wedues. 4 . an even keel, and in the afternoon, having warped her over, and waited for high water, we laid her ashore on the sand bank on the south side of the river, for the damage she had received already from the great descent of the ground, made me afraid to lay her broad side to the shore in the same place from which we had just floated her. I was now very desirous to make another trial to come at her bottom, where the sheathing had been rubbed off, but though she had scarcely four feet water under her, when the tide was out, yet that part was not dry. On the 5th, I got one of the carpenter's crew, a man in Thutsday S . whom I could confide, to go down again to the strip's bottom, and examine the place. He reported, that three streaks of the sheathing, about eight feet long, were wanting, and that the main plank had been a little rubbed; this account perfectly agreed with the report of the Master, and others, who had been under her bottom before: I had the comfort however to find the carpenter of opinion that this would be of little consequence, and therefore the other damage being repaired, she was again floated at high-water, and moored along-side the beach, where the stores had been X 8 deposited 5"}, {"page_label": "Seite 164", "page_text": "164 LIEUTENANT COOK's VOYAGE 1770.

This day, Mr. Banks crossed to the other side of the harbour, where, as he walked along a sandy beach, he found innumerable fruits, and many of them such as no plants which he had discovered in this country produced: among others were some cocoa- nuts, which Tupia said had been opened by a kind of crab, which from his description we judged to be the same that the Dutch call Bent's Krabbe, and which we had not seen in these seas. All the vegetable substances which he found in this place, were encrusted with marine productions, and covered with barnacles; a sure sign that they must have come far by sea, and, as the trade-wind blows right upon the shore, probably from Terra del Espirito Santo, which has been mentioned already. The next morning, Mr. Banks, with Lieutenant Gore, and three men, set out in a small boat up the river, with a view to spend two or three days in an excursion, to examine the country, and kill some of the animals which had been so often seen at a distance. On the 7th, I sent the Master again out to sound about the shoals, the account which he had brought me of a channel being by no means satisfactory; and we spent the remainder of this day, and the morning of the next, in fishing, and other necessary occupations. About four o'clock in the afternoon, Mr. Banks and his party returned, and gave us an account of their expedition. Having proceeded about three leagues among swamps and mangroves, they went up into the country, which they found to differ but little from what they had seen before: they pursued their course therefore up the river, which at length was contracted into a najTow channel, and was bounded, not by swamps and mangroves, but by steep banks,"}, {"page_label": "Seite 165", "page_text": "ROUND THE WORLD. 165 banks, that were covered with trees of a most beautiful ver- J77° : dure, among which was that which in the West Indies is *■ called Mohoe , or the bark tree, the hibiscus tiliaceus ; the land Sunday 8 ' within was in general low, and had a thick covering of long grafs: the foil seemed to be such as promised great fertility, to any who should plant and improve it. In the course of the day, Tupia saw an animal, which, by his description, Mr. Banks judged to be a wolf: they also saw three other animals, but could neither catch nor kill one of them, and a kind of bat, as large as a partridge, but this also eluded all their diligence and skill. At night, they took up their lodging close to the banks of the river, and made a fire, but the musquitos swarmed about them- in such numbers, that their quarters were almost untenable ; they followed them into the smoke, and almost into the fire, which, hot as the climate was, they could better endure than the stings of these insects, which were an intolerable torment. The fire, the sties, and the want of a better bed than the ground, rendered the night extremely uncomfortable, so that they passed it not in steep, but in restless wishes for the return of day. With the first dawn they set out in search of game, and in a walk of many miles, they saw four animals of the same kind, two of which Mr. Banks's greyhound fairly chaced, but they threw him out at a great distance, by leaping over the long thick grafs, which prevented his running: this animal was observed not to run upon four legs, but to bound or hop forward upon two, like the Jerbua, or Mus Jaculus. About noon, they returned to the boar, and again proceeded up the river, which was soon contracted into a fresh water brook, where, however, the tide rose to a considerable height; as evening approached, it became low water, and it was then so shallow that they were obliged to get out of the boat and drag her along, till they could find a place in which"}, {"page_label": "Seite 166", "page_text": "LIEUTENANT COOK's VOYAGE 166 177°. which they might, with some hope of rest, pass the night. Such a place at length offered, and while they were getting the Sunday 8. t hj n g S out of the hoat, they observed a smoke at the distance of about a furlong: as they did not doubt but that some of the natives, with whom they had so long and earnestly desired to become personally acquainted, were about the fire, three of the party went immediately towards it, hoping that so small a number would not put them to flight: when they came up to the place, however, they found it deserted, and therefore they conjectured that before they had discovered the Indians, the Indians had discovered them. They found the fire still burning, in the hollow of an old tree that was become touch-wood, and several branches of trees newly broken down, with which children appeared to have been playing: they observed also many footsteps upon the sand, below high water mark, which were certain indications that the Indians had been recently upon the spot. Several houses were found at a little distance, and some ovens dug in the ground, in the same manner as those of Otaheite, in which victuals appeared to have been dressed since the morning, and, scattered about them, lay some shells of a kind of datum, and some fragments of roots, the refuse of the meal. After regretting their disappointment, they repaired to their quarters, which was a broad sand bank, under the shelter of a buff. Their beds were plantain leaves, which they spread upon the sand, and which were as soft as a mattress ; their cloaks served them for bed-clothes, and some bunches of grafs for pillows: with these accommodations they hoped to pass a better night than the last, especially as, to their great comfort, not a musquito was to be seen. Here then they lay down, and, such is the force of habit, they resigned themselves to sleep, without once reflecting upon the probability and danger of being found by the Indians in that"}, {"page_label": "Seite 167", "page_text": "ROUND THE WORLD. 1677 that situation.

Soon after the arrival of this party, the Master also returned, having been seven leagues out to sea, and he was now of opinion, that there was no getting out where before he thought there had been a pastage; his expedition however was by no means without its advantage, for having been a second time upon the rock where he had seen the large cockles, he met with a great number of turtle, three of which he caught, that together weighed seven hundred and ninety-one pounds, though he had no better instrument than a boat hook. Monday 9. The next morning, therefore, I sent him out again, with proper instruments for taking them, and Mr. Banks went with him, but the success did not at all answer our expectations, for, by the unaccountable conduct of the officer, not a single turtle was taken, nor could he be persuaded to return : Mr. Banks, however, went ashore upon the reef, where he saw several of the large cockles, and having collected many shells, and marine productions, he returned at eleven o'clock at night, in his own small boat, the Master still continuing with the large one upon the rock. In the afternoon, seven or eight of the natives had appeared on the south side of the river, and two of them came down to the sandy point, opposite to the ship; but upon seeing me put off in a boat to speak with them, they all ran away with the greatest precipitation. As the Master continued absent with the boat all night, I was forced to send the Second Lieutenant for him, early the Tueiday 10. next morning in the yawl; and soon after four of the natives appeared upon the sandy point, on the north side of the river, having with them a small wooden canoe, with out- 2 riggers:"}, {"page_label": "Seite 169", "page_text": "ROUND THE WORLD. 169 riggers: they seemed for some time to be busily employed in striking fish: some of our people were for going over to them in a boat, but this I would by no means permit, repeated experience having convinced me that it was more likely to prevent, than procure an interview. I was determined to try what could be done by a contrary method, and accordingly let them alone, without appearing to take the least notice of them: this succeeded so well, that at length two of them came in the canoe within a musket shot of the ship, and there talked a great deal in a very loud tone: we understood nothing that they said, and therefore could answer their harangue only by shouting, and making all the signs of invitation and kindness that we could devise. During this conference, they came, insensibly, nearer and nearer, holding up their lances, not in a threatening manner, but as if to intimate that if we offered them any injury, they had weapons to revenge it. When they were almost along-side of us, we threw them some cloth, nails, beads, paper, and other trifles, which they received without the least appearance of satisfaction: at last, one of the people happened to throw them a small fish; at this they expressed the greatest joy imaginable, and intimating, by signs, that they would fetch their companions, immediately paddled away towards the shore. In the mean time some of our people, and among them Tupia, landed on the opposite side of the river : the canoe, with all the four Indians, very soon returned to the strip, and came quite along-side, without expressing any fear or distrust.

We continued together, with the utmost cordiality, till dinner time, and then giving them to understand that we were going to eat, we invited them, by signs, to go with us: this however they declined, and as soon as we left them, they went away in their canoe. One of these men was somewhat above the middle age, the other three were young; they were in general of the common stature, but their limbs were remarkably small; their skin was of the colour of wood foot, or what would be called a dark chocolate colour; their hair was black, but not woolly; it was short cropped, in some lank, and in others curled.

This gentleman was distinguished by an ornament of a very striking appearance: it was the bone of a bird, nearly as thick as a man's finger, and five or six inches long, which he had thrust into a hole, made in the gristle that divides the nostrils; of this we had seen one instance, and only one, in New Zealand ; but upon examination, we found that among all these people this part of the nose was perforated, to receive an ornament of the fame kind : they had also holes in their ears, though nothing was then hanging to them, and had bracelets upon the upper part of their arms, made of plaited hair, so that, like the inhabitants of Terra del Fuego, they seem to be fond of ornament, though they are absolutely without apparel; and one of them, to whom I had given part of an old shirt, instead of throwing it over any part of his body, tied it as a fillet round his head. They brought with them a fish, which they gave us, as we supposed, in return for the fish that we had given them the day before.

As they had received the fish that was thrown into their canoe, when they first approached the ship, with so much pleasure, some fish was offered to them now, and we were greatly surprized to see that it was received with the greatest indifference: they made signs, however, to some of the people, that they should dress it for them, which was immediately done, but after eating a little of it, they threw the rest to Mr. Banks's dog. They staid with us all the forenoon, but would never venture above twenty yards from their canoe. We now perceived that the colour of their skin was not so dark as it appeared, what we had taken for their complexion, being the effects of dirt and smoke, in which, we imagined, they contrived to sleep, notwithstanding the heat of the climate, as the only means in their power to keep off the musquitos. Among other things that we had given them when we first saw them, were some medals, which we had hung round their necks by a riband ; and these ribands were so changed by smoke, that we could not easily distinguish of what colour they had been: this incident led us more narrowly to examine the colour of their skin. While these people were with us, we saw two others on the point of land that lay one the opposite side of the river, at the distance of about two hundred yards, and by our glasses discovered them to be. a woman and a boy; the woman, like the rest, being stark naked. We observed, that all of them were remarkably clean-limbed, and exceedingly active and nimble.

Their canoe was not above ten feet long, and very narrow, but it was fitted with an outrigger, much like those of the islands, though in every respect very much inferiorwhen it was in shallow water, they set it on with poles, and when iin deep, they worked it with paddles about four feet long: it contained just four people, so that the people who visited us to day went away at two turns. Their lances were like those that we had seen in Botany Bay, except that they had but a single point, which in some of them was the sting of the ray, and barbed with two or three sharp bones of the fame fish: it was indeed a most terrible weapon, and the instrument which they used in throwing it, seemed to be formed with more art than any we had seen before.

After this they ventured on board, where I left them, to all appearance much entertained, and went again with Mr. Banks to take a view of the country; but chiefly to indulge an anxious curiosity, by looking round us upon the sea, of which our wishes almost persuaded us we had formed an idea more disadvantageous than the truth. After having walked about seven or eight miles along the shore to the northward, we ascended a very high hill, and were soon convinced that the danger of our situation was at least equal to our apprehensions; for in whatever direction we turned our eyes, we saw rocks and shoals without number, and no passage out to sea, but through the winding channels between them, which could not be navigated without the last degree of difficulty and danger. We returned therefore to the ship, not in better spirits than when we left it; we found several natives still on board, and we were told that the turtles, of which we had then no less than twelve upon the deck, had fixed their attention more than any thing else in the ship.

They first asked us, by signs, to give them one; and being refused, they expressed, both by looks and gestures, great disappointment and anger. At this time we happened to have no victuals dressed, but I offered one of them some biscuit, which he snatched and threw overboard with great disdain.

While this was doing, the Indians went to a place at some distance, where several of our people were washing, and where our nets, among which was the seine, and a great quantity of linen, were laid out to dry; here they again set fire to the grass, entirely disregarding both threats and entreaties. We were therefore obliged to discharge a musquet, loaded with small shot, at one of them, which drew blood at the distance of about forty yards, and this putting them to flight, we extinguished the fire at this place before it had made much progress ; but where the grafs had been first kindled, it spread into the woods to a great distance. As the Indians were still in sight, I fired a musquet, charged with ball, abreast of them among the mangroves, to convince them that they were not yet out of our reach: upon hearing the ball they quickened their pace, and we soon lost sight of them. We thought they would now give us no more trouble ; but soon after we heard their voices in the woods, and perceived that they came nearer and nearer. I set out, therefore, with Mr. Banks and three or four more, to meet them : when our parties came in sight of each other, they halted ; except one old man, who came forward to meet us: at length he stopped, and having uttered some words, which we were very sorry we could not understand, he went back to his companions, and the whole body slowly retreated. We found means however to seize some of their darts, and continued to follow them about a mile: we then fat down upon some rocks, from which we could observe their motions, and they also fat down at about an hundred yards distance.

We found in this party four persons whom we had never seen before, who as usual were introduced to us by name; but the man who had been wounded in the attempt to burn our nets and linen, was not among them; we knew however that he could not be dangerously hurt, by the distance at which the shot reached him. We made all of them presents of such trinkets as we had about us, and they walked back with us towards the ship: as we went along, they told us, by signs, that they would not set sire to the grass any more; and we distributed among them some musquet balls, and endeavoured to make them understand their use and effect. When they came abreast of the ship, they sat down, but could not be prevailed upon to come on board; we therefore left them, and in about two hours they went away, soon after which we perceived the woods on fire at about two miles distance. If this accident had happened a very little while sooner, the consequence might have been dreadful; for our powder had been aboard but a few days, and the store tent, with many valuable things which it contained, had not been removed many hours.

In the afternoon we got every thing on board the ship, new birthed her, and let her swing with the tide; and at night the Master returned, with the discouraging account that there was no passage for the ship to the northward. The next morning, at low water, I went and sounded and buoyed the bar, the ship being now ready for the sea. We saw no Indians this day, but all the hills round us for many miles were on fire, which at night made a most striking and beautiful appearance. The a 1 st passed without our getting sight of any of the inhabitants, and indeed without a single incident worth notice. On the 22d, we killed a turtle for the day's provision, upon opening which we found a wooden harpoon or turtle- peg, about as thick as a man's finger, near fifteen inches long, and bearded at the end, such as we had seen among the natives, sticking through both shoulders: it appeared to have been struck a considerable time, for the wound had perfectly healed up over the weapon. Early in the morning of the 23d, I sent some people into the country to gather a supply of the greens which have been before mentioned by the name of Indian Kale; and one of them having straggled from the rest, suddenly fell in with four Indians, three men and a boy, whom he did not fee till, by turning short in the wood, he found himself among them. They had kindled a fire, and were broiling a bird of some kind, and part of a Kanguroo, the remainder of which, and a cockatoo, hung at a little distance upon a tree: the man, being unarmed, was at first greatly terrified ; but he had the presence of mind not to run away, judging very rightly, 4"}, {"page_label": "Seite 181", "page_text": "ROUND THE WORLD. rightly, that he was most likely to incur danger by appear- 1770. ing to apprehend it; on the contrary, he went and fat down > ^ ul) ' ., by them, and, with an air of chearfulnefs and good humour, Monday offered them his knife, the only thing he had about him which he thought would be acceptable to them; they received it, and having handed it from one to the other, they gave it him again: he then made an offer to leave them; but this they seemed not disposed to permit: still however he dissembled his fears, and fat down again; they considered him with great attention and curiosity, particularly his clothes, and then felt his hands and face, and satisfied themselves that his body was of the same texture with their own. They treated him with the greatest civility, and having kept him about half an hour, they made signs that he might depart: he did not wait for a second dismission, but when he left them, not taking the direct way to the ship, they came from their fire and directed him; so that they well knew whence he came. In the mean time, Mr. Banks, having made an excursion on the other side of the river to gather plants, found the greatest part of the cloth that had been given to the Indians lying in a heap together, probably as useless lumber, not worth carrying away; and perhaps j if he had sought further, he might have found the other trinkets ; for they seemed to set very little value upon any thing we had, except our turtle, which was a commodity that we were least able to spare.

On the 25th, having made an excursion up the river, I found a canoe belonging to our friends the\"Indians, whom we had not seen since the a stair of the turtle; they had left it tied to some mangroves, about a mile distant from the stiip, and I could fee by their fires that they were retired at least six miles directly inland. As Mr..Banks was again gleaning the country for his Natural History on the 26th, he had the good fortune to take an animal of the Opojsum tribe: it was a female, and with it he took two young ones: it was found much to resemble the remarkable animal of the kind, which Mons. de BufFon has described in his Natural History by the name of Phalanger , but it was not the fame. Monf. Bufifon supposes this tribe to be peculiar to America, but in this he is certainly mistaken ; and probably, as Pallas has observed in his Zoology, the Phalanger itself is a native of the East Indies, as the animal which was caught by Mr. Banks resembled it in the extraordinary conformation of the feet, in which it differs from animals of every other tribe. On the 27th, Mr. Gore shot a Kanguroo, which, with the skin, entrails, and head, weighed eighty-faur pounds.

The wind continued in the same quarter, and with the same violence, till five o'clock in the morning of the 29th, Sunday when it fell calm ; soon after a light breeze sprung up from the land, and it being about two hours ebb, I sent a boat to see what water was upon the bar ; in the mean time we got the anchor up, and made all ready to put to sea.

At the new and full of the moon it is high water between nine and ten o'clock: it must also be remembered, that this part of the coast is so barricaded with shoals, as to make the harbour still more difficult of access; the safest approach is from the southward, keeping the main land close upon the board all the way.

Over the south point is some high land, but the north point is formed by a low sandy beach, which extends about three miles to the northward, where the land begins again to be high. The chief refreshment that we procured here, was turtle, but as they were not to be had without going five leagues out to sea, and the weather was frequently tempestuous,, we did not abound with this dainty : what we caught, as well as the fish, was always equally divided among us all by weight, the meanest person on board having the same share as myself; and I think everyycommander, in such-a voyage as this, will find it his interest to follow the fame rule. In several parts of the sandy beaches, and sand hills near the sea, we found purstain, and'a kind of bean that grows upon a stalk, which creeps along the ground: the purstain we found very good when it was boiled, and the beans are not to be despised, for we found them of great service to our sick: the best greens, however, that could be procured here, were the tops of the coccos, which have been mentioned al-- ready, as known in the West Indies by the name of Indian kale these were, in our opinion, not much inferior to spinnage, which in taste they somewhat resemble; the roots indeed are not good, but they might probably be meliorated by proper cultivation. They are found here chiefly in boggy ground. The few cabbage palms that we met with, were in general small, and' yielded so little cabbage that they were not worth seeking. Besides the kanguroo, and the opossum that have been already mentioned, and a kind of polecat, there are wolves upon this part of the coast, if we were not deceived by the tracks upon the ground, and several species of serpents; some of the serpents are venomous, and some harmless: 3 there"}, {"page_label": "Seite 187", "page_text": "ROUND THE WORLD. 187 there are no tame animals here except dogs, and of these *7/°- we saw but two or three, which frequently came about the tents, to pick up the scraps and bones that happened to lie Saturday 4 scattered near them. There does not indeed seem to be many of any animal, except the kanguroo; we scarcely saw any other above once, but this we met with almost every time we went into the woods. Of land fowls we saw crows, kites, hawks, cockatoos of two forts, one white and the other black, a very beautiful kind of loriquets, some parrots, pigeons of two or three forts, and several small birds not known in Europe. The water fowls are herns, whistling ducks, which perch, and, I believe, roost upon trees, wild geese, eurlieus, and a few others, but these do not abound. The face of the country, which has been occasionally mentioned before, is agreeably diversified by hill and valley, lawn and wood. The soil of the hills is hard, dry, and stony, yet it produces coarse grafs besides wood: the foil of the plains and vallies is in some places sand, and in some clay; in some also it is rocky and stony, like the hills; in general, however, it is well clothed, and has at least the appearance of fertility. The whole country, both hill and valley, wood and plain, abounds with ant hills, some of which are six or eight feet high, and twice as much in circumference. The trees here are not of many forts; the gum tree, which we found on the southern part of the coast, is the most common, but here it is not so large: on each side of the river, through its whole course, there are mangroves in great numbers, which in some places extend a mile within the coast. The country is in all parts well watered, there being several sine rivulets at a small distance from each other, but none in the place where we lay, at least not during the time we were there, which was the dry season; we were however well supplied with water by springs, which were not far off.

E. and clear weather, but as I did not intend to fail till the morning, I sent all the boats to the reef, to get what turtle and shell fish they could. At low water, I went up to the mast-head, and took a view of the shoals, which made a very threatening appearance: I could fee several at a remote distance, and part of many of them was above water. The sea appeared most open to the north east of the turtle reef, and I came to a resolution to stretch out that way close upon a wind, because if we should find no passage, we could always return the way we went. In the evening, the boats brought in a turtle, a sting-ray, and as many large cockles as came to about a pound and a half a man, for in each of them there was not less than two pounds of meatin the night also we caught several sharks, which, though not a dainty, were an acceptable increase of our fresh provision. In the morning, I waited till half ebb before I weighed, because at that time the shoals begin to appear, but the wind then blew so hard that I was obliged to remain at anchor: in the afternoon, however, the gale becoming more moderate, we got under fail, and stood out upon a wind N.E. by E. leaving the turtle reef to windward, and having the pinnace sounding ahead: we had not kept this course long, before we discovered shoals before us, and upon both the bows ; and at half an hour after four, having run about eight miles, the pinnace made the signal for shoal water, where we little expected it: upon this we tacked, and stood on and off, while the pinnace stretched farther to the eastward, and night approaching, I came to an anchor in twenty fathom water, with a muddy bottom.

In the morning of the 6th, we had a strong gale, so that instead Monday of weighing, we were obliged to veer away more cable, and strike our top-gallant yards. At low water, myself, with several of the officers, kept a look-out at the mast-head, to fee if any passage could be discovered between the shoals, but nothing was in view except breakers, extending from, the 8. round by the E. as far as N. W. and out to sea beyond - the reach of our sight; these breakers, however, did not appear to be caused by one continued shoal, but by several, which lay detached from each other : on that which lay farthest to the eastward, the sea broke very high, which, made me think it was the outermost, for upon many of these within, the breakers were inconsiderable, and from about half ebb to half flood, they were not to be seen at all, which makes sailing among them still more dangerous, especially as the shoals here consist principally of coral rocks, which are as steep as a wall; upon some of them however, and generally at the north end, there are patches of sand, which are covered only at high water, and which are to be discerned at some distance. Being now convinced that there was no passage to sea, but through the labyrinth formed by these shoals, I was altogether at a loss which way to steer, when the weather should permit us to get under fail.

These anxious deliberations engaged us till eleven o'clock at night, when the ship drove, and obliged us to veer away to a cable and one third, which brought her up ; but in the morning, the gale increasing, she drove again, and we therefore let go the small bower, and veered away to a whole cable upon it, and two cables on the other anchors, yet she still drove, though not so fast; we then got down top-gallant masts, and struck the yards and top-masts close down, and at last had the satisfaction to find that she rode. Cape Bedford now bore W. S.W. distant three leagues and an half, and in this situation we had shoals to the eastward, extending from the S. E. by 8. to the N. N. W. the nearest of which was about two miles distant. As the gale continued, with little remission, we rode till seven o'clock in the morning of the ioth, when, it being more moderate, we weighed, and stood in for the land, having at length determined to seek a passage along the shore to the northward, still keeping the boat ahead: during our run in we had from nineteen to twelve fathom : after standing in about an hour, we edged away for three small islands that lay N. N. E. i E. three leagues from Cape Bedford, which the Master had visited while we were in port. At nine o'clock, we were abreast of them, and between them and the main between us and the main there was another low island, which lies N.

At noon, we were got between the head land and the three islands: from the head land we were distant two leagues, and from the islands four; our latitude, by observation, was 14 0 51'. We now thought we saw a clear opening before us. and hoped that we were once more out of danger; in this hope, however, we soon found ourselves disappointed, and for that reason I called the head land Cape Flattery. It lies in latitude 14 0 56' S. longitude 214° 43' W. and is a lofty promontory, making next the sea in two hills, which have a third behind them, with low sandy ground on each side: it may however be still better known by the three islands out at seathe northermost and largest lies about five leagues from the Cape, in the direction of N.

As soon as the ship was at anchor, I went ashore upon the point, which is high, and afforded me a good view of the sea coast, trending away N. W. by W. eight or ten leagues, which, the weather not being very clear, was as far as I could fee. Nine or ten small low islands, and some shoals, appeared off the coast; I saw also some large shoals between the main and the three high islands, without which, I was clearly of opinion there were more islands, and not any part of the main. Except the point I was now upon, which I called Point Lookout, and Cape Flattery, the main land, to the northward of Cape Bedford, is low, and chequered with white sand and green bushes, for ten or twelve miles inland, beyond which it rises to a considerable height. To the northward of Point Look-out, the coast appeared to be shoal and fiat, for a considerable distance, which did not encourage the hope that the channel we had hitherto found in with the land would continue. Upon this point, which was narrow, and consisted of the finest white sand we had ever seen, we discovered the footsteps of people, and we saw also smoke and fire at a distance up the country. In the evening, I returned to the ship, and resolved the next morning to visit one of the high islands in the offing, from the top of which, as they lay five leagues out to sea, I hoped to discover more distinctly the situation of the shoals, and the channel between them.

In my way, I pasted over a reef of coral rock and sand, which lies about two leagues from the island, and I left another to leeward, which lies about three miles from it: on the north part of the reef, to the leeward, there is a low sandy island, with trees upon it; and upon the reef which we pasted over, we saw several turtle .- we chased one or two, but having little time to spare, and the wind blowing fresh, we did not take any. About one o'clock, we reached the island, and immediately ascended the highest hill, with a mixture of hope and fear, proportioned to the importance of our business, and the uncertainty of the event: when I looked round, I discovered a reef of rocks, lying between two and three leagues without the islands, and extending in a line N. W. and 8. E. farther than I could fee, upon which the sea broke in a dreadful surf; this however made me think that there were no shoals beyond them, and I conceived hopes of getting without these, as I perceived several breaks or openings in the reef, and deep water between that and the islands. I continued upon this hill till sunset, but the weather was so hazy during the whole time that I came down much disappointed. After reflecting upon what I had seen, and comparing the intelligence I had gained with what I expected, I determined to stay upon the island all night, hoping that the morning might be clearer, and afford me a more distinct and comprehensive view. We therefore took up our lodging under the shelter of a bush which grew upon the beach, and at three in the morning, having sent the pinnace with one of the Mates whom I had brought out with me, to found between the island and the reefs, and examine what appeared to be a channel through them, I climbed the hill a second time; but to my great disappointment found the weather much more Vol. III.

About noon the pin- ' nace returned, having been as far as the reef, and found between fifteen and twenty-eight fathom of water; but it blew so hard that the Mate did not dare to venture into one of the channels, which he said appeared to him to be very narrow: this however did not discourage me, for I judged from his description of the place he had been at, that he had seen it to disadvantage. While I was busy in my survey, Mr. Banks was attentive to his favourite pursuit, and picked up several plants which he had not before seen. We found the island, which is visible at twelve leagues distance, to be about eight leagues in circumference, and in general very rocky and barren. On the north west side, however, there are some sandy bays, and some low land, which is covered with long thin grafs, and trees of the fame kind with those upon the main: this part also abounded with lizards of a very large size, some of which we took. We found also frefhi water in two places; one was a running stream, but that was a little brackish where I tasted it, which was close to the sea; the other was a standing pool, close behind the sandy beach, and this was perfectly sweet and good. Notwithstanding the distance of this island from the main, we saw,, to our great surprize, that it was sometimes visited by the natives; for we found seven or eight frames of their huts, and vast heaps of shells, the fish of which we supposed had been their food. We observed that all these huts were built upon eminences, and entirely exposed to the S.

As we saw no animals upon _ this place but lizards, I called it Lizard Island ; the other Sunday 12 two high istands, which lie at the distance of four or five miles from it, are comparatively small; and near them lie three others smaller still, and low, with several shoals or reefs, especially to the S.

Upon this island we saw an incredible number of birds, chiefly fea-fowl: we found also the nest of an eagle with young ones, which we killed ; and the nest of some other bird, we knew not what, of a most enormous size; it was built with sticks upon the ground, and was no less than six and twenty feet in circumference, and two feet eight inches high. We found also that this place had been visited by the Indians, probably to eat turtle, many of which we saw upon the island, and a great number of their lhells, piled one upon another in different places. To this spot we gave the name of Eagle Island, and after leaving it, we steered S.W. directly for the ship, sounding all the way, and we had never less than eight fathom, nor more than fourteen; the same depth of water that I had found between this and Lizard Island. When I got on board, the Master informed me that he had been down to the low islands, between which and the main I had directed him to' found; that he judged them to lie B b 3 about"}, {"page_label": "Seite 196", "page_text": "igS LIEUTENANT COOK'S VOYAGE * 77 °* about three leagues from the main; that without them he '-\"-' found from ten to fourteen fathom, and between them and.

Upon one of these low islands he slept, and was ashore upon others ; and he reported, that he saw every where piles of turtle-shells, and fins hanging upon the trees in many places, with the flesh upon them, so recent, that the boat's crew eat of them: he saw also two spots, clear of grafs, which appeared to have been lately dug up, and from the shape and size of them he conjectured they were graves. After considering what I had seen myself, and the report of the Master, I was of opinion that the passage to leeward would be dangerous, and that, by keeping in with the main, we should run the rifle of being locked in by the great reef, and at last be compelled to return back in search of another passage, by which, or any other accident that should cause the same delay, we should infallibly lose our passage to the East Indies, and endanger the ruin of the voyage, as we had now.but little more than three months provisions on board at short allowance. ! Having stated this opinion, and'tKe facts and appearance's upon which it was founded, to the officers, it was unanimously agreed, that the best thing we could do would be to quit the coast altogether, till we could approach it with less danger. Monday 13. In the morning therefore, at break of day, we got under fail, and stood out N. E. for the north west end of Lizard Island, leaving Eagle Island to windward, and some other islands and shoals to the leeward, and having the pinnace ahead to ascertain the depth of water in every part of our course.

The passage or channel, through which we pasted into the open sea beyond the reef, lies in latitude 14 0 32' 8. and may always be known by the three high islands within it, which I have called the Islands of Direction, because by these a stranger may find a safe passage through the reef quite to the main. The channel lies from Lizard Island N. E. j- N. distant three leagues, and is about one third of a mile broad, and not more in length. Lizard Island, which is, as I have before observed, the largest and the northermost of the three, affords safe anchorage under the north west side, fresh water, and wood for fuel. The low islands and Ihoals also which lie between it and the main abound with turtle and fisli, which may probably be caught in all seasons of the year, except when the weather is very tempestuous ; so that, all things considered, there is not perhaps a better place for strips to refrelh at upon the whole coast than this island. And before I dismiss it, I must observe, that we found upon it, as well as upon the beach in and about Endeavour River, bamboos, cocoa nuts, pumice stone, and the feeds of plants which are not the produce of this country, and which it is reasonable to suppose are brought from the eastward by the trade winds. The islands which were discovered by Quiros, and called Australia del Espiritu Santa, lie in this parallel; but how far to the eastward cannot now be ascertained: in most charts they are placed in the fame longitude with this country, which, as appears by the account of his voyage 2 that"}, {"page_label": "Seite 199", "page_text": "ROUND THE WORLD. that has been published, he never saw; for that places his 1770. discoveries no less than two and twenty degrees to the east- > Auguft '_, ward of it. Uotid ^ As soon as we were without the reef, we brought to, and having hoisted in the boats, we stood off and on upon a wind all night; for I was not willing to run to leeward till I had a whole day before me. In the morning, at day-break, Lizard Tuesday 14. Island bore S. 15 E. distant ten leagues; and we then made fail and stood away N. N. W. 4 W. till nine o'clock, when we stood N. W. ~ N. having the advantage of a fresh gale at S.E. At noon, our latitude by observation was 13 0 46' 8. and at this time we had no land in sight. At six in the evening we shortened fail and brought the ship to, with her head to the N. E.; and at six in the morning made sail and steered west, Wednes. 15. in order to get within sight of the land, that I might be sure not to overshoot the passage, if a passage there was, between this land and New Guinea. At noon, our latitude by observation was 13° 2 S-, longitude 216° W.; which was i° 23' W. of Lizard Island: at this time we had no land in sight; but a little before one o'clock, we saw high land from the mast-head, bearing W.

What we took for the end of them in this direction, however, soon appeared to be only an opening in. the reef; for we presently saw them again, extending northward beyond the reach of our sight.

At. sunset the northermost part of it that was in sight bore from us N. by E. and was two or three leagues distant; this however being the best tack to clear it, we kept standing to the northward with all the fail we could set till midnight; when, being afraid of standing too far in this direction, we tacked and stood to the southward, our run from sunset to this time being six leagues N. and N. by E. When we had stood about two miles S. 8. E. it fell calm ; we had sounded several times during the night, but had no bottom with one hundred and forty fathom, neither had we any ground now with the fame length of line; yet, about 'stursday 16, four in the morning, we plainly heard the roaring of the surf, and at break of day saw it foaming to a vast height, at not more than a mile's distance. Our distress now returned upon us with'double force; the waves which rolled in upon the reef, carried us towards it very fast ; we could reach no ground with an anchor, and had not a breath of wind for the fail. In this dreadful situation, no resource was left us but the boats ; and to aggravate our misfortune the pinnace was under repair: the longboat and yawl however were put into the water, and sent ahead to tow, which, by the help of our sweeps abaft, got the ship's head round to the northward ; which, if it could not prevent our destruction, might at least delay it. But it was six o'clock before this was effected, and we were not then a hundred yards from the rock upon which the fame billow which washed the side of the ship, broke to a tremendous height the very next time it rose; so that between us and destruction there was only a dreary valley, no wider than the base of one wave, and even now the sea under us was unfathomable, at least no bottom was to be found with a hundred and twenty fathom. During this scene of distress the carpenter had found means to patch up the pinnace; so that she was hoisted"}, {"page_label": "Seite 201", "page_text": "ROUND TIID WORLD. 301 Tioisted out, and sent ahead, in aid of the other boats, to tow; but all our efforts would have been ineffectual, if, just at this crisis of our fate, a light air of wind had not sprung up, so light, that at any other time we should not have observed it, but which was enough to turn the scale in our favour, and, in conjunction with the assistance which was afforded us by the boats, to give the ship a perceptible motion obliquely from the reef. Our hopes now revived; but in less than ten minutes it was again a dead calm, and the ship was again driven towards the breakers, which were not now two hundred yards distant. The same light breeze however returned before we had lost all the ground it had enabled us to gain, and lasted about ten minutes more. During this time we discovered a small opening in the reef, at about the distance of a quarter of a mile: I immediately sent one of the Mates to examine it, who reported that its breadth was not more than the length of the ship, but that within it there was smooth water: this discovery seemed to render our escape possible, and that was all, by pushing the ship through the opening, which was immediately attempted. It was uncertain indeed whether we could reach it; but if we should succeed thus far, we made no doubt of being able to get through: in this however we were disappointed, for having reached it by the joint assistance of our boats and the breeze, we found that in the mean time it had become high water, and to our great surprize we met the tide of ebb rushing out of it like a mill-stream. We gained however some advantage, though in a manner directly contrary to our expectations ; we found it impossible to go through the opening, but the stream that prevented us, carried us out about a quarter of a mile ; it was too narrow for us to keep in it longer; yet this tide of ebb so much assisted the boats that by noon we had got an offing of near two Vol. III.

V ^ VC} £ or we were Pall embayed in the reef; and the tide of ebb being spent, the tide of flood, notwithstanding our utmost efforts, again drove the ship into the bight. About this time, however, we saw another opening, near a mile to the westward, which I immediately sent the First Lieutenant, Mr. Hicks, in the small boat to examine: in the mean time we struggled hard with the flood, sometimes gaining a little, and sometimes losing; but every man still did his duty, with as much calmness and regularity as if no danger had been near. About two o'clock, Mr. Hicks returned with an account that the opening was narrow and dangerous, but that it might be pasted: the possibility of passing it was sufficient encouragement to make the attempt, for all danger was less imminent than that of our present situation. A light breeze now sprung up at E. N. E. with which, by the help of our boats, and the very tide of stood that without an opening would have been our destruction, we entered it, and were hurried through with amazing rapidity, by a torrent that kept us from driving against either side of the channel, which was not more than a quarter of a mile in breadth. While we were shooting this gulph, our soundings were from thirty to seven fathom, very irregular, and the ground at bottom very foul. As soon as we had got within the reef we anchored in nineteen fathom, over a bottom of coral and shells. And now, such is the vicissitude of life, we thought ourselves happy in having regained a situation, which but two days before it was the utmost object of our hope to quit. Rocks and shoals are always dangerous to the mariner, even where their situation has been ascertained ; they are more dangerous in seas which have never before been navigated, and in this"}, {"page_label": "Seite 203", "page_text": "ROUND THE WORLD. so 5 this part of the globe they are more dangerous than in any -770. other; for here they are reefs of coral rock, rising like a r|6 always overflowed at high-water, and at low-water dry in many places ; and here the enormous waves of the vast Southern Ocean, meeting with so abrupt a resistance, break, with inconceivable violence, in a surf which no rocks or storms in the northern hemisphere can produce. The danger of navigating unknown parts of this ocean was now greatly increased by our having a crazy ship, and being short of provisions and every other necessary; yet the distinction of a first discoverer made us chearfully encounter every danger, and submit to every inconvenience; and we chose rather to incur the censure of imprudence and temerity, which the idle and voluptuous so liberally bestow upon unsuccessful fortitude and perseverance, than leave a country which we had discovered unexplored, and give colour to a charge of timidity and irresolution. Having now congratulated ourselves upon getting within the reef, notwithstanding we had so lately congratulated ourselves upon getting without it, I resolved to keep the main land on board in my future route to the northward, whatever the consequence might be; for if we had now gone without the reef again, it might have carried us so far from the coast, as to prevent my being able to determine, whether this country did, or did nor, join to New Guinea ; a question which 1 was determined to resolve from my first coming within fight of land. However, as I had experienced the disadvantage of having a boat under repair, at a time when it was possible I might want to use her, I determined to remain fast at anchor, till the pinnace was perfectly refitted.

At four o'clock in the afternoon the boats returned with two hundred and forty pounds of the meat of fhell-sifli, chiefly of cockles, some of which were as much as two men could move, and contained twenty pounds of good meat. Mr. Banks also brought back many curious shells, and Mollusca ; besides many species of coral, among which was that called the 'Tubipom mustca . At six o'clock in the morning, we got under fail and stood away to the N.

The main land appeared to be low and barren, interspersed with large patches of the very sine white sand, which we had found upon Lizard Island and different parts of the main. The boats had seen many turtle upon the shoals which they passed, but it blew too hard for them to take any. At noon, our latitude by observation was 12 0 , and our longitude 217 0 25': our depth of water was fourteen fathom ; and our course and distance, reduced to a strait line, was, between this time and the preceding noon N. 29 W. thirty two miles.

To the southward of the Cape the shore forms a large open bay, which I called Newcastle Bay, and in which are some small low islands and shoals; the land adjacent is also very low, flat, and sandy. The land of the northern part of the Cape is more hilly, the vallies seem to be well clothed with wood, and the shore forms some small bays, in which there appeared to be good anchorage. Close to the eastern point of the Cape are three small islands, from one of which a small ledge of rocks runs out into the sea: there is also an island close to the northern point. The island that forms the streight or channel through which, we had passed, lies about four miles without these, which, except two, are very small: the southermost is the largest, and much higher than any part of the main land. On the north west side of this island there appeared to be good anchorage, and on shore, vallies that promised both wood and water.

Upon this island we had seen many of the in- habitcknts when we first came\"to. an anchor, and when I we04 into the boat^ with. a ptirty of men, accompanied by Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, in order to go ashore, we saw ten of them upon a hill: nine of them were armed with such lances as we had been used to see, and the tenth had a bow, and a bundle of arrows, which we had never seen in the possession of the natives of this country before: we also observed, that two of them had large ornaments of mother * ~ of pearl hanging round their necks. Three of these, one of ^ whom was the bowman, placed themselves upon the beach - abreast of us, and we expected that they would have opposed our landing, but when we came within about a musleet's soot of the beach, they walked' leisurely away. We immediately climbed the highest hill, which was not more than three times as high as the mast-head, and the most barren of 5 D d 2 any $ *"}, {"page_label": "Seite 212", "page_text": "LI2 LIEUTENANT CGOK's VOYAGE 1770; August.

The ^and to the north west of it consisted of a great number of islands of various extent, and different heights, ranged one behind another, as far to the northward and westward as I could fee, which could not be less than thirteen leagues. As I was.now about to quit the eastern coast of New Holland, which I had coasted from latitude 38 to this place, and-which I am consistent no European had ever seen before, I once more hoisted English colours, and though I had already taken poffeslion of several particular parts, I now took poffeslion of the whole eastern coast,, from latitude 38° to this place, Jatitude io-*-S. in.right of his Majesty King George the Third, by the name of New South Wales, with all the bays, harbours, rivers, and islands, situated upon it: we then sired three vollies of small arms, which were answered by the fame number from* the ihip.

We continued at anchor all night, and between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, we saw three or four of the natives upon the beach gathering shell-fish; we discovered, by"}, {"page_label": "Seite 213", "page_text": "ROUND THE WORLD.

VI. Departure from New South TVales ; a particular Description of the Country , its ProduSls , and People : A Specimen of the Language , and some Observations upon the Currents and 'Tides. 1770. August. O F this country, its products, and its people, many particulars have already been related in the course of the narrative, being so interwoven with the events, as not to admit of a separation. I shall now give a more full and circumstantial description of each, in which, if some things should happen to be repeated, the greater part will be found new. New Holland, or, as I have now called the eastern coast, New South Wales, is of a larger extent than any other country in the known world that does not bear the name of a continent: the length of coast along which \"we failed, reduced to a strait line, is no less than twenty-feven degrees of latitude, amounting to near 2000 miles, so that its square surface must be much more than equal to all Europe. To the southward of 33 or 34, the land in general is low and level; farther northward it is hilly, but in no part can be called mountainous, and the hills and mountains, taken together, make but a small part of the surface, in comparison with the vallies and plains. It is upon the whole rather barren than fertile, yet the rising ground is chequered by woods and lawns, and the plains and vallies are in many places covered with herbage: the soil however is frequently sandy, and"}, {"page_label": "Seite 219", "page_text": "ROUND THE WORLD. and many of the lawns, or savannahs, are rocky and barren, especially to the northward, where, in the best spots, vegetation was less vigorous than in the southern part of the country ; the trees were not so tall, nor was the herbage so rich. The grafs in general is high, but thin, and the trees, where they are largest, are seldom less than forty feet asunder ; nor is the country inland, as far as we could examine it, better clothed than the sea coast. The banks of the bays are covered with mangroves, to the distance of a mile within the beach, under which the foil is a rank mud, that is always overflowed by a spring tide ; farther in the country we sometimes met with a bog, upon which the grafs was very thick and luxuriant, and sometimes with a valley, that was clothed with underwood: the foil in some parts seemed to be capable of improvement, but the far greater part is such as can admit of no cultivation. The coast, at least that part of it which lies to the northward of 25 0 S. abounds with fine bays and harbours, where vessels may lie in perfect security from all winds. If we may judge by the appearance of the country while we were there, which was in the very height of the dry season, it is well watered : we found innumerable small brooks and springs, but no great rivers ; these brooks, however, probably become large in the rainy season. Thirsty Sound was the only place where fresh water was not to be procured for the ship, and even there one or two small pools were found in the woods, though the face of the country was every where intersected by salt-creeks, and mangrove land. Of trees there is no great variety. Of those that could be called timber, there are but two sorts; the largest is the gum tree, which grows all over the country, and has been men- Ee 2 tioned"}, {"page_label": "Seite 220", "page_text": "220 LIEUTENANT COOK's VOYAGE 1770. August. tioned already: it has narrow leaves, not much unlike a willow ; and the gum, or rather resin, which it yields, is of a deep red, and resembles the Jcinguis draconis ; possibly it may be the fame, for this substance is known to be the produce of more than one plant. It is mentioned by Dampier, and is perhaps the fame that Tasman found upon Diemen's Land, where he fays he saw '' Gum of the trees, and gum \" lac of the ground.\" The other timber tree is that which grows somewhat like our pines, and has been particularly mentioned in the account of Botany Bay. The wood of both these trees, as I have before remarked, is extremely hard and heavy. Besides these, here are trees covered with a soft bark that is easily peeled off, and is the same that in the East Indies is used for the caulking of strips. We found here the palm of three different sorts. The first, which grows in great plenty to the southward, has leaves that are plaited like a fan: the cabbage of these is small, but exquisitely sweet; and the nuts, which it bears in great abundance, are very good food for hogs. The second sort bore a much greater resemblance to the true cabbage tree of the West Indies ; its leaves were large and pinnated, like those of the cocoa-nut; and these also produced a cabbage, which though not so sweet as the other, was much larger. The third fort, which, like the second, was found only in the northern parts, was seldom more than ten feet high, with small pinnated leaves, resembling those of some kind of fern: it bore no cabbage, but a plentiful crop of nuts, about the size of a large chesnut, but rounder: as we found the hulls of these scattered round the places where the Indians had made their fires, we took for granted that they were fit to eat; those however who made the experiment paid dear for their knowlege of the contrary, for 4 they"}, {"page_label": "Seite 221", "page_text": "ROUND THE WORLD. 82 r they operated both as an emetic and cathartic with great violence. Still, however, we made no doubt but that they were eaten by the Indians\" and judging that the constitution of the hogs might be as strong as theirs, though our own had proved to be so much inferior, we carried them to the stye; the hogs eat them, indeed, and for some time we thought without suffering any inconvenience; but in about a week they were so much disordered that two of them died,, and the rest were recovered with great difficulty. It is probable,, however, that the poisonous quality of these nuts may lie in the juice, like that of the cassada of the West Indies ; and that the pulp, when dried, may be not only wholesome, but nutricious. Besides these species of the palm, and mangroves, there were several small trees and ffirubs altogether unknown in Europe ; particularly one which produced a very poor kind of sig; another that bore what we called a plum, which it resembled in colour, but not in shape, being flat on the sides like a little cheese; and a third that bore a kind of purple apple; which, after it had been kept a few days, became eatable, and tasted somewhat like a damascene. Here is a great variety of plants to enrich the collection of a botanist, but very few of them are of the esculent kind- A small plant, with long, narrow, grassy leaves, resembling that kind of bulrush which in England is called the Cat's- tail, yields a resin of a bright yellow colour, exactly resembling gambouge, except that it does not stain; it has a sweet smell, but its properties we had no opportunity to discover,, any more than those of many others with which the natives appear to be acquainted, as they have distinguished them by names. I have already mentioned the root and leaves of a plant* resembling the coccos of the West Indies, and a kind of bean;. 1770.

Most of the fruits of this country, such as they are, have been mentioned already. We found one in the southern part of the country resembling a cherry, except that the stone was soft; and another not unlike a pine-apple in appearance, but of a very disagreeable taste, which is well known in the East Indies, and is called by the Dutch Byn Appel Boomen. Of the quadrupeds, I have already mentioned the dog, and particularly described the kanguroo, and the animal of the opossum kind, resembling the phalanges of Bufson; to which I can add only one more, resembling a polecat, which ' the natives call ^uoll-, the back is brown, spotted with white, and the belly white unmixed. Several of our people said they had seen wolves ; but perhaps, if we had not seen tracks that favoured the account, we might have thought them little more worthy of credit than he who reported that he had seen the devil. Of batts, which hold a middle place between the beasts and the birds, we saw many kinds, particularly one which, as I have observed already, was larger than a partridge; we were not fortunate enough to take one either alive or dead, but it was supposed to be the same as Bustbn has described by the name of Rouset or Rouges.

The land-birds, are crows, parrots, paroquets, cockatoos, and other birds of the same kind, of exquisite beauty; pigeons, doves, quails, bustards, herons, cranes, hawks, and eagles. The pigeons stew in numerous flocks, so that, notwithstanding their extreme shyness, our people frequently killed ten or twelve of them in a day: these birds are very beautiful, and crested very differently from any we had seen before. Among other reptiles, here are serpents of various kinds, some noxious, and some harmless; scorpions, centipieds, and lizards. The insects are but few. The principal are the mufquito, and the ant. Of the ant there are several sorts; some are as green as a leaf, and live upon trees, where they build their nests of various sizes, between that of a man's head and his sist. These nests are of a very curious structure: they are formed by bending down several of the leaves, each of which is as broad as a man's hand, and gluing the points of them together, so as to form a purse; the viscus used for this purpose, is an animal juice, which Nature has enabled them to elaborate. Their method of first bending down the leaves, we had not an opportunity to observe ; but we saw thousands uniting all their strength to hold them in this position, while other busy multitudes were employed within, in applying the gluten that was to prevent their returning back. To satisfy ourselves that the leaves were bent, and held down by the effort of these diminutive artificers, we disturbed them in their work, and as soon as they were driven from their station, the leaves on which they Ttere employed sprung up with a force much greater than we 8 could"}, {"page_label": "Seite 224", "page_text": "LIEUTENANT COOK's VOYAGE 224 * 7 70- could have thought them able to conquer by any combina- August. tion of their strength. But though we gratified our curiosity at their expence, the injury did not go unrevenged ; for thousands immediately threw themselves upon us, and gave us intolerable pain with their stings, especially those which took possession of our necks and our hair, from whence they were not easily driven : the sting was scarcely less painful than that of a bee; but, except it was repeated, the pain did not last more than a minute. Another fort are quite black, and their operations and manner of life are not less extraordinary. Their habitations are the inside of the branches of a tree, which they contrive to excavate by working out the pith almost to the extremity of the slenderest twig; the tree at the fame time flourishing, as if it had no such inmate. When we first found the tree, we gathered some of the branches, and were scarcely less astonissied than we should have been to find that we had prophaned a consecrated grove, where every tree, upon being wounded, gave signs of life ; for we were instantly covered with legions of these animals, swarming from every broken bough, and inflicting their stings with incessant violence. They are mentioned by Rumphius in his Herbarium Amboi- nense, vol. ii. p. 2 57 . ; but the tree in which he saw their dwelling, is very different from that in which we found them. A third kind we found nested in the root of a plant, which grows on the bark of trees in the manner of mifletoe, and which they had perforated for that use. This root is commonly as big as a large turnip, and sometimes much bigger : when we cut it, we found it intersected by innumerable winding passages, all filled with these animals, by which however the vegetation of the plant did not appear to have"}, {"page_label": "Seite 225", "page_text": "ROUND THE WORLD. have suffered any injury. We never cut one of these roots that was not inhabited, though some were not bigger than a hazle-nut. The animals themselves are very small, not more than half as big as the common red ant in England. They had stings, but scarcely force enough to make them felt; they had however a power of tormenting us in an equal, if not a greater degree\" for the moment we handled the root, they swarmed from innumerable holes, and running about those parts of the body that were uncovered, produced a titillation more intolerable than pain, except it is increased to great violence. Rumphius has also given an account of this bulb and its inhabitants, vol. vi. p. 120. where he mentions another fort that are black. We found a fourth kind, which are perfectly harmless, and almost exactly resemble the white-ants of the East Indies ; the architecture of these is still more curious than that of the others. They have houses of two sorts, one is suspended on the branches of trees, and the other erected upon the ground: those upon the trees are about three or four times as big as a man's head, and are built of a brittle substance, which seems to consist of small parts of vegetables kneaded together with a glutinous matter, which their bodies probably supply; upon breaking this crust, innumerable cells, swarming with inhabitants, appear in a great variety of winding directions, all communicating with each other, and with several apertures that lead to other nests upon the fame tree ; they have also one large avenue, or covered way, leading to the ground, and carried on under it to the other nest or house that is constructed there. This house is generally at the root of a tree, but not of that upon which their other dwellings are constructed: it is formed like an irregularly sided cone, and sometimes is more than six feet Vol. III.

Some are smaller, and these are generally flat sided, and very much resemble in figure the stones which are seen in many parts of England, and supposed to be the remains of druidical antiquity. The outside of these is of well tempered clay, about two inches thick; and within are the cells, which have no opening outwards, but communicate only with the subterranean way to the houses on the tree, and to the tree near which they are constructed, where they ascend up the root, and so up the trunk and branches, under covered ways of the same kind as those by which they descended from their other dwellings. To these structures on the ground they probably retire in the winter, or rainy seasons, as they are proof against any wet that can fall; which those in the tree, though generally constructed under some overhanging branch, from the nature and thinness of their crust or wall, cannot be. The sea in this country is much more liberal of food to the inhabitants than the land; and though fish is not quite so plenty here as they generally are in higher latitudes, yet we seldom hauled the seine without taking from fifty to two hundred weight. They are of various forts ; but, except the mullet, and some of the shell-fish, none of them are known in Europe: most of them are palatable, and some are very delicious. Upon the shoals and reef there are incredible numbers of the finest green turtle in the world, and oysters of various kinds, particularly the rock-oyster and the pearl- oyster. The gigantic cockles have been mentioned already ; besides which there are sea-crayfifh, or lobsters, and crabs; of these however we saw only the shells.

The people whom he saw were indeed inhabitants of a part of the coast very distant from that which we visited; but we also saw inhabitants upon parts of the coast very distant from each other, and there being a perfect uniformity in person and customs among them all, it is reasonable to conclude, that distance in another direction has not considerably broken it. The number of inhabitants in this country appears to be very small in proportion to its extent. We never saw so many as thirty of them together but once, and that was at Botany Bay, when men, women, and children, assembled upon a rock to fee the ship pass by: when they manifestly formed a resolution to engage us, they never could muster above fourteen or fifteen fighting men; and we never saw a number of their sheds or houses together that could accommodate a larger party. It is true, indeed, that we saw only the sea-coast on the eastern side ; and that, between this and the western shore, there is an immense tract of country wholly unexplored: but there is great reason to believe that this immense tract is either wholly desolate, or at least still more thinly inhabited than the parts we visited. It is impossible that the inland country should subsist inhabitants at all seasons without cultivation ; it is extremely improbable that the inhabitants of the coast should be totally ignorant of arts of cultivation, which were practised inland ; and it is equally improbable that, if they knew such arts, there should be no traces of them among them.

The only tribe with which we had any intercourse, we found where the ship was careened; it consisted of one and twenty persons; twelve men, seven women, one boy, and one girl: the women we never saw but at a distance; for when the men came over the river they were always left behind. The men here, and in other places, were of a middle size, and in general well made, clean limbed, and remarkably vigorous, active, and nimble: their countenances were not altogether without expression, and their voices were remarkably soft and effeminate. Their skins were so uniformly covered with dirt, that it was very difficult to ascertain their true colour: we made several attempts, by wetting our fingers and rubbing it, to remove the incrustations, but with very little effect. With the dirt they appear nearly as black as aNegroe; and according to our best discoveries, the skin itself is of the colour of wood foot, or what is commonly called a chocolate colour. Their features are far from being disagreeable, their noses are not flat, nor are their lips thick; their teeth are white and even, and their hair naturally long and black, it is however universally cropped short; in general it is strait, but sometimes it has a flight curl;, we saw none that was not matted and filthy, though without oil or grease, and to our great astonishment free from lice. Their beards were of the fame colour with their hair, and bushy and thick : they are not however suffered to grow long.

Both sexes, as I have already observed, go stark naked, and seem to have no more sense of indecency in discovering the whole body, than we have in discovering our hands and face. Their principal ornament is the bone which they thrust through the cartilage that divides the nostrils from each other: what perversion of taste could make them think this a decoration, or what could prompt them, before they had worn it or seen it worn, to suffer the pain- and inconvenience that must of necessity attend it, is perhaps beyond the power of human sagacity to determine: as this bone is as thick as a man's finger, and between five and six inches long, it reaches quite across the face, and so effectually stops- up both the nostrils that they are forced to keep their mouths wide open for breath, and snuffle so when they attempt to speak, that they are scarcely intelligible even to each other. Our seamen, with some humour, called it their spritsail-yard ; and indeed it had so ludicrous an-appearance, that till we were used to it, we found it difficult to refrain from laughter. Beside this nose-jewel, they had necklaces made of shells, very neatly cut and strung together ; bracelets of small cord, wound two or three times about the upper part of their arm, and a string of plaited human hair about as thick as a thread of yarn, tied round the waist. Besides, these, some of them had gorgets of shells hanging round the neck, so as to reach cross the breast. But though these people* wear no clothes, their bodies have a covering besides the dirt, for they paint them both white and red: the red is commonly laid on in broad patches upon the shoulders and* breast; and the white in stripes, some narrow, and some- broad: the narrow were drawn over the limbs, and the broad? over the body, not without some degree of taste.

The red seemed to be ochre, but what the white was we could not discover; it was close grained, saponaceous to the touch, and almost as heavy as white lead; possibly it might be a kind of Steatites , but to our great regret we could not procure a bit of it to examine. They have holes in their ears, but we never saw any thing worn in them. Upon such ornaments as they had, they set so great a value, that they would never part with the least article for any thing we could osser; which was the more extraordinary as our beads and ribbons were ornaments of the same kind, but of a more regular form and more showy materials. They had indeed no idea of traffic, nor could we communicate any to them: they received the things that we gave them ; but never appeared to understand our signs when we required a return. The same indifference which prevented them from buying what we had, prevented them also from attempting to steal: if they had coveted more, they would have been less honest ; for when we refused to give them a turtle, they were enraged, and attempted to take it by force, and we had nothing else upon which they seemed to set the least value ; for, as I have before observed, many of the things that we had given them, we found left negligently about in the woods, like the playthings of children, which please only while they are new. Upon their bodies we saw no marks of disease or sores, but large scars in irregular lines, which appeared to be the remains of wounds which they had inflicted upon themselves with some blunt instrument, and which we understood by signs to have been memorials of grief for the dead. They appeared to have no fixed habitations, for we saw nothing like a town or village in the whole country.

At Botany Bay, where they were best, they were just high enough for a man to sit upright in; but not large enough for him to extend himself in his whole length in any direction: they are built with pliable rods about as thick as a man's finger, in the form of an oven, by sticking the two ends into the ground, and then covering them with palm leaves, and broad pieces of bark : the door is nothing but a large hole at one end, opposite to which the fire is made, as we perceived by the ashes. Under these houses, or sheds, they steep, coiled up with their heels to their head ; and in this position one of them will hold three or four persons. As we advanced northward, and the climate became warmer, we found these sheds still more flight: they were built, like the others, of twigs, and covered with bark; but none of them were more than four feet deep, and one side was intirely open: the close side was always opposed to the course of the prevailing wind, and opposite to the open side was the sire, probably more as a defence from the musquitos than the cold. Under these hovels it is probable, that they thrust only their heads and the upper part of their bodies, extending their feet towards the fire. They were set up occasionally by a wandering hord in any place that would furnish them for a time with subsistence, and left behind them when, after it was exhausted, they went away: but in places where they remained only for a night or two, they slept without any shelter, except the bushes or grass, which is here near two feet high. We observed, however, that though the sleeping huts which we found upon the main, were always turned from the prevailing wind, those upon the islands were turned towards it; which seems to be a proof that they have a mild season here, during which the 1770.

The only furniture belonging to these houses that fell under our observation, is a kind of oblong vefiel made of bark, by the simple contrivance of tying up the two ends with a withy, which not being cut off serves for a handle; these we imagined were used as buckets to fetch water from the spring, which may be supposed sometimes to be at a considerable distance. They have however a small bag, about the size of a moderate cabbage-net, which is made by laying threads . loop within loop, somewhat in the manner of knitting used by our ladies to make purses. This bag the man carries loose upon his back by a small string which passes over his head; it generally contains a lump or two of paint and resin, some fish-hooks and lines, a shell or two, out of which their hooks are made, a few points of darts, and their usual ornaments, which includes the whole worldly treasure of the richest man among them. Their fish-hooks are very neatly made, and some of them are exceedingly small. For striking turtle they have a peg of wood which is about a foot long, and very well bearded; this fits into a socket at the end of a staff of light wood, about as thick as a man's wrist, and about seven or eight feet long: to the staff is tied one end of a loose line about three or four fathom long, the other end of which is fastened to the peg. To strike the turtle, the peg is fixed into the socket, and when it has entered his body, and is retained there by the barb, the stafl' sties off and serves for a stoat to trace their victim in the water;-it assists also to tire him, till they can overtake him with their canoes, and haul him ashore.

Their lines are from the thickness of a half inch rope to the fineness of a hair, and are made of some vegetable substance, but what in particular we had no opportunity to learn. Their food is chiefly fish, though they sometimes contrive to kill the kanguroo, and even birds of various kinds; notwithstanding they are so fihy that we found it difficult to get within reach of them with a fowling-piece. The only vegetable that can be considered as an article of food is the yam; yet doubtless they eat the several fruits which have been mentioned among other productions of the country; and indeed we saw the shells and hulls of several of them lying about the places where they had kindled their fire. They do not appear to eat any animal food raw; but having no vessel in which water can be boiled, they either broil it upon the coals, or bake it in a hole by the help of hot stones, in the same manner as is practised by the inhabitants of the islands in the South Seas. i;;o.

As they have no nets, they catch fish only by striking, or with a hook and line, except such as they find in the hollows of the rocks, and shoals, which are dry at half ebb.

I have observed that when they went from our tents upon the banks of Endeavour river, we could trace them by the fires which they kindled in their way; and we imagined that these fires were intended some way for the taking the kanguroo, which we observed to be so much afraid of fire, that our dogs could scarcely force it over places which had been newly burnt, though the fire was extinguished. They produce fire with great facility, and spread it in a wonderful manner. To produce it they take two pieces of dry soft wood, one is a stick about eight or nine inches long, the other piece is flat: the stick they shape into an obtuse point at one end, and pressing it upon the other, turn it nimbly by holding it between both their hands as we do a chocolate mill, often shifting their hands up, and then moving them down upon it, to increase the pressure as much as possible. By this method they get fire in less than two minutes, and from the smallest spark they increase it with great speed and dexterity. We have often seen one of them run along the shore, to all appearance with nothing in his hand, who. stooping down for a moment, at the distance of every fifty or a hundred yards, left fire behind him, as we could fee first by the smoke, and then by the flame among the drift wood, and other litter which was scattered along the place.

There are perhaps few things in the history of mankind more extraordinary than the discovery and application of fire: it will scarcely be disputed that the manner of producing it, whether by collision or attrition, was discovered by chance : but its first effects would naturally strike those to whom it was a new object, with consternation and terror: it would appear to be an enemy to life and nature, and to torment and destroy whatever was capable of being destroyed or tormented; and therefore it seems not easy to conceive what should incline those who first saw it receive a transient existence from chance, to reproduce it by design. It is by no means probable that those who first saw fire, approached it with the same caution, as those who are familiar with its effects, so as to be warmed only and not burnt; and it is reasonable to think that the intolerable pain which, at its first appearance, it must produce upon ignorant curiosity, would sow perpetual enmity between this element and mankind ; and that the fame principle which incites them to crush a serpent, would incite them to destroy fire, and avoid all means by which it would be produced, as soon as they were known. These circumstances considered, how men became sufficiently familiar with it to render it useful, seems to be a problem very difficult to solve : nor is it easy to account for the first application of it to culinary purposes, as the eating both animal and vegetable food raw, must have become a habit, before there was fire to dress it, and those who have considered the force of habit will readily believe, that to men who had always eaten the flesh of animals raw, it would be as disagreeable dressed, as to those who have always eaten it dressed, it would be raw.

Among the rude inhabitants of a cold country, neither any operation of art, or occurrence of accident, could be supposed so easily to produce fire by attrition, as in a climate where every thing is hot, dry, and adust, teeming with a latent fire which a flight degree of motion was sufficient to call forth; in a cold country therefore, it is natural to suppose that fire was produced by the accidental collision of two metallic substances, and in a cold country, for that reason, the same expedient was used to produce it by design: but in hot countries, where two combustible substances easily kindle by attrition, it is probable that the attrition of such substances first produced sire, and here it was therefore natural for art to adopt the same operation, with a view to produce the same effect. It may indeed be true that fire is now produced in many cold countries by attrition, and in many hot by a stroke; but perhaps upon enquiry there may appear reason to conclude that this has arisen from the communication of one country with another, and that with respect to the original production of fire in hot and cold countries, the distinction is well founded. There may perhaps be some reason to suppose that men became gradually acquainted with the nature and effects of sire, by its permanent existence in a volcano, there being remains of volcanoes, or vestiges of their effects, in almost every part of the world : by a volcano, however, no method of producing fire, otherwise than by contact, could be learnt; the"}, {"page_label": "Seite 237", "page_text": "ROUND THE WORLD. 2 37 die production and application of fire therefore, still seem to afford abundant subject of speculation to the curious. The weapons of these people are spears or lances, and these are of different kinds: some that we saw upon the southern part of the coast had four prongs, pointed with bone, and barbed; the points were also smeared with a hard resin, which gave them a polish, and made them enter deeper into what they struck. To the northward, the lance has but one point: the shaft is made of cane, or the stalk of a plant somewhat resembling a bulrush, very strait and light, and from eight to fourteen feet long, consisting of several joints, where the pieces are let into each other, and bound together; to this are fitted points of different kinds; some are of hard heavy wood, and some are the bones of fish: we saw several that were pointed with the stings of the sting-ray, the largest that they could procure, and barbed with several that were smaller, fastened on in a contrary direction*, the points of wood were also sometimes armed with sharp pieces of broken shells, which were stuck in, and at the junctures covered with resin: the lances that are thus barbed, are indeed dreadful weapons, for when once they have taken place, they can never be drawn back without: tearing away the flesh, or leaving the sharp ragged splinters of the bone or shell which forms the beard, behind them in the wound. These weapons are thrown with great force and dexterity; if intended to wound at a short distance, between ten and twenty yards, simply with the hand, but if at the distance of forty or fifty, with an instrument which we called a throwing stick. This is a plain smooth piece of a hard reddish wood, very highly polished, about two inches broad, half an inch thick, and three feet long, with a small knob, or hook at one end, and a cross piece about three or four inches long at the other: the knob at one end is received in 2 a small! 1770.

Besides these lances, we saw no offensive weapon upon this coast, except when we took our last view of it with our glasses, and then we thought we saw a man with a bow and arrows, in which it is possible we might be mistaken. We saw, however, at Botany Bay, a shield or target, of an oblong shape, about three feet long, and eighteen inches broad, which was made of the bark of a tree: this was fetched out of a hut by one of the men that opposed our landing, who, when he ran away, left it behind him, and upon taking it up, we found that it had been pierced through with a single pointed lance near the center. These shields are certainly in frequent use among the people here, for though this was the only one that we saw in their possession, we frequently found trees from which they appeared manifestly to have been cut, the marks being easily distinguished from those that were made by cutting buckets: sometimes also we found the shields cut out, but not yet taken off from the tree, the edges of the bark only being a little raised by wedges, so that these people appear to have discovered that the bark of a tree becomes thicker and stronger by being suffered to remain upon the trunk after it has been cut round.

Those on the southern part of the coast are nothing , more than a piece of bark, about twelve feet long, tied together at the ends, and kept open in the middle by small bows of wood: yet in a vessel of this construction we once saw three people. In shallow water they are set forward by a pole, and in deeper by paddles, about eighteen inches- long, one of which the boatman holds in each hand ; me anas they are, they have many conveniences, they draw but little water, and they are very light, so that they go upon mud banks to pick up shell fishs, the most important use to which they can be applied, better perhaps than vessels of any other construction. We observed, that in the middle of these canoes there was a heap of sea-weed, and upon that a small fire; probably that the fish may be broiled and eaten the moment it is caught. The canoes that we saw when we advanced farther to the northward, are not made of bark, but of the trunk of a tree hollowed, perhaps by fire. They are about fourteen feet long, and, being very narrow, are fitted with an outrigger to prevent their oversetting. These are worked with paddles, that are so large as to require both hands to manage one of them : the outside is wholly unmarked by any tool, but at each end the wood is left longer at the top than at the bottom, so that there is a projection beyond the hollow part resembling the end of a plank; the sides are tolerably thin,, but how the tree is felled and fashioned,- we had no^ opporttr- nity to learn.

The utmost freight of these canoes is four people, and if more at any time wanted to come over the river, one of those who came first was obliged to go back for the rest: from this circumstance, we conjectured that the boat we saw, when we were lying in Endeavour River, was the only one in the neighbourhood: we have however some reason to believe that the bark canoes are also used where the wooden ones are constructed, for upon one of the small islands where the natives had been fishing for turtle, we found one of the little paddles which had belonged to such a boar, and would have been useless on board any other. By what means the inhabitants of this country are reduced to such a number as it can subsist, is not perhaps very easy to guess ; whether, like the inhabitants of New Zealand, they are destroyed by the hands of each other in contests for food ; whether they are swept off by accidental famine, or whether there is any cause which prevents the increase of the species, must be left for future adventurers to determine. That they have wars, appears by their weapons ; for supposing the lances to serve merely for the striking of fish, the shield could be intended for nothing but a defence against men; the only mark of hostility, however, which we saw among them, was the perforation of the shield by a spear which has been just mentioned, for none of them appeared to have been wounded by an enemy.

From the account that has been given of our commerce with them, it cannot be supposed that we should know much of their language ; yet as this is an object of great curiosity, especially to the learned, and of great importance in their researches into the origin of the various nations that have been discovered, we took some pains to bring away such a specimen of it as might, in a certain degree, answer the purpose, and I shall now give an account how it was procured. If we wanted to know the name of a stone, we took a stone up into our hands, and as well as we could, intimated by signs that we wished they should name it: the word that they pronounced upon the occasion, we immediately wrote down. This method, though it was the best we could contrive, might certainly lead us into many mistakes j for if an Indian was to take-up a stone, and ask us the name of it, we might answer a pebble or a flint; so when we took up a stone, and asked an Indian the name of it, he might pronounce a word that distinguished the species and not the Vol. III.

In another island, called Purmerent, they have an hospital, where people are said to recover much faster than at Batavia. In a third, called Kuyper, they have warehouses belonging to the Company, chiefly for rice, and other merchandize of small value; and here the foreign ships, that are to be laid down at Ourust, another of these islands, which with Kuyper has been mentioned before, discharge their cargoes at wharfs which are very convenient for the purpose. Here the guns, fails, and other stores of the Falmouth, a man of war, which was condemned at this place when she was returning from Manilla, were deposited, and the ship herself remained in the harbour with only the warrant officers on board for many years.

From latitude Z2°, and somewhat higher, down to Sandy Cape, in latitude 24 ° 46', we constantly found a current setting to the southward, at the rate of about ten or fifteen miles a day, being more or less, according to our distance from the land, for it always ran with more force in shore than in the offing; but I could never satisfy myself whether the flood-tide came from the southward, the eastward, or the northward: I inclined to the opinion that it came from the south-east, but the first time we anchored off the coast, which was in latitude 24° 30', about ten leagues to the south east of Bustard Bay, I found it come from the north west ; on the contrary, thirty leagues farther to the northwest, on the south side of Keppel Bay, I found that it came from the east, and at the northern , part of that Bay it came from the northward, but'with a much flower motion than it had come from the east: on the east side of the Bay of Inlets, it set strongly to the westward, as far as the opening of Broad Sound ; but on the north side of that Sound, it came with a very flow motion from the north west; and when we lay at anchor before Repulse Bay, H h 2 it"}, {"page_label": "Seite 244", "page_text": "244 1 77 °* August. ^--- LIEUTENANT COOK's VOYAGE it came from the northwardto account for its course in all fhis variety of directions, we need only admit that the flood- tide comes from the east or south east. It is well known, that where there are deep inlets, and large creeks into low lands, running up from the sea, and not occasioned by rivers of fresh water, there will always be a great indraught of the stood-tide, the direction of which will be determined by the position or direction of the coast which forms the entrance of such inlet, whatever be its course at sea; and where the tides are weak, which upon this coast is generally the cafe, a large inlet will, if I may be allowed the expression, attract the stood-tide for many leagues. A view of the chart will at once illustrate this position. To the northward of Whitsunday's Paslage there is no large inlet, consequently the flood sets to the northward, or north westward, according to the direction of the coast, and the ebb to the south, or south eastward, at least such is their course at a little distance from the land, for very near it they will be influenced by small inlets. I also observed, that we had only one high tide in twenty-four hours, which happened in the night. The difference between the perpendicular rife of the water in the day and the night, when there is a spring-tide, is no less than three feet, which, where the tides are so inconsiderable as they are here, is a great proportion of the whole difference between high and low water. This irregularity of the tides, which is worthy of notice, we did not discover till we were run ashore, and perhaps farther to the northward it is still greater: after we got within the reef the second time, we found the tides more considerable than we had ever done before, except in the Bay of Inlets, and possibly this may be owing to the water being more confined between the shoals; here also the flood sets to the"}, {"page_label": "Seite 245", "page_text": "ROUND THE WORLD. 245 the north west, and continues in the fame direction to the 1770* extremity of New Wales, from whence its direction is west and south west into the Indian sea.

At noon, our latitude, by observation, was io° 30'S. As I was resolved not to leave the anchor behind, while there remained a possibility of recovering, it, I sent the boats again after dinner, with a small line, to discover where it lay; this being happily effected, we swept for it with a hawser, and by the same hawser hove the ship up to it: we proceeded to weigh it, but just"}, {"page_label": "Seite 246", "page_text": "246 LIEUTENANT COOK's VOYAGE 1770.

It extends N. W. and S. E. and is about five leagues in circuit. Our depth of water, from the time we weighed till now, was nine fathom, but it soon shallowed to seven fathom ; and at half an hour after one, having run eleven miles between noon and that time, the boat which was a head made the signal for shoal water; we immediately let go an anchor, and brought the fliip up with all the sails standing, for the boat having just been relieved, was at but a little distance : upon looking out from the ship, we saw shoal water almost all round us, both wind and tide at the fame time setting upon it. The ship was in six fathom, but upon sounding round her, at the distance of half a cable's length, we found scarcely two. This shoal reached from the east, round by the north and west, as far as the south west, so that there was no way for us to get clear but that which we came. This was another hair's-breadth escape, for it was near high water, and there run a short cockling sea, which must very soon have bulged the fliip if she had struck; and if her direction had been half a cable's length more either to the right or left, Hie must have struck before the signal for the flioal was made.

Our latitude by observation was now 8° 52' 8. which is in the fame parallel as that in which the southern parts of New Guinea are laid down in the charts ; but there are only two points so far to the south, and I reckoned that we were a degree to the westward of them both, and therefore did not see the land, which trends more to the northward. We found the sea here to be in many parts covered with a brown scum, such as sailors generally call spawn. When I first saw it, I was alarmed, fearing that we were among shoals; but upon sounding, we found the same 'depth of water as in other places. This scum was examined both by Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, but they could not determine what it was: it was formed of innumerable small particles, not more than half a line in length, each of which in the microscope appeared to consist of thirty or forty tubes; and each tube was divided through its whole length by small partitions into many cells, like the tubes of the Conferva: they were supposed to belong to the vegetable kingdom, because upon burning them they produced no smell like that of an animal substance. The same appearance had been observed upon the coast of Brazil and New Holland, but never at any considerable distance from the shore.

After steering S.W. by W. six miles, we had shoal water on our starboard bow, which I sent the yawl to sound, and at the same time hauled off upon a wind till four o'clock, and though during that time we had run six miles, we had not deepened our water an inch. I then edged away S. W. four miles more; but finding it still shoal water, I brought to and called the boats aboard. At this time, being between three and four leagues from the shore, and the yawl having found only three fathom water in the place to which I had sent her to found, I hauled off close upon a wind, and weathered the shoal about half a mile. Between one and two o'clock, we pasted a bay or inlet before which lies a small istand that seems to shelter it from the southerly winds ; but I very much doubt whether there is sufficient depth of water behind it for shipping. I could not attempt to determine the question, because the S. E. trade wind blows right into the bay, and we had not as yet had any breeze from the land.

As all this coast appears to have been very minutely examined by the Dutch, and as our track with the soundings will appear by the chart, it is sufficient to say, that we continued our course to the northward with very shallow water, upon a bank of mud, at such a distance from the shore as that it could scarcely be seen from the ship, till the zd of September. During this time we made many attempts to get near enough to go on shore, but without success; and having now lost six days of fair wind, at a time when we knew the south east monsoon to be nearly at an end, we began to be impatient of farther delay, and determined to run the ship in as near to the shore as possible, and then land with the pinnace, while she kept plying off and on, to examine the produce of the country, and the disposition of the inhabitants. For the two last days we had early in the morning a light breeze from the shore, which was strongly impregnated with the fragrance of the trees, shrubs, and herbage that covered it, the smell being something like that of Gum Benjamin.

Hitherto we had seen no signs of inhabitants at this place ; but as soon as we got ashore we discovered the prints of human feet, which could not long have been impressed upon the sand, as they were below high water mark: we therefore concluded that the people were at no great distance, and, as a thick wood came down within a hundred yards of the water, we thought it necessary to proceed with caution, lest we should fall into an ambuscade and our retreat to the boat be cut off. We walked along the skirts of the wood, and at the distance of about two hundred yards from the place where we landed, we came to a grove of cocoa-nut trees, which stood upon the banks of a little brook of brackiih water. The trees were of a small growth, but well hung with fruit; and near them was a shed or hut, which had been covered with their leaves, though most of them were now fallen off: about the hut lay a great number of the shells of the fruit, some of which appeared to be just fresh from the tree. We looked at the fruit very wishfully, but not thinking it safe to climb, we were obliged to leave it without tasting a single nut. At a little distance from this place we found plantains, and a breadfruit tree, but it had nothing upon it j and having now advanced about a quarter of a mile from the boat, three Indians ruffed out of the wood with a hideous shout, at about the distance of a hundred yards ; and as they ran towards us\" the foremost threw something out of his hand, which flew on one fide of him, and burnt exactly like gunpowder, but made no report: the other two instantly threw their lances at us; and, as no time was now to be lost, we discharged our pieces."}, {"page_label": "Seite 253", "page_text": "ROUND THE WORLD. pieces, which were loaded with small shot. It is probable that they did not feel the shot, for though they halted a moment, they did not retreat; and a third dart was thrown at us. As we thought their farther approach might be prevented with less risk of life, than it would cost to defend ourselves against their attack if they should come nearer, we loaded our pieces with ball, and fired a second time: by this discharge it is probable that some of them were wounded ; yet we had the satisfaction to fee that they all ran away with great agility. As I was not disposed forcibly to invade this country, either to gratify our appetites or our curiosity, and perceived that nothing was to be done upon friendly terms,- we improved this interval, in which the destruction of the natives was no longer necessary to our own defence, and with all expedition returned towards our boat. As we were advancing along the shore, we perceived that the two men on board made signals that more Indians were coming down and before we got into the water we saw several of them coming round a point at the distance of about five hundred yardsit is probable that they had met with the three who first attacked us; for as soon as they saw us they halted, and seemed to wait till their main body should come up. We entered the water, and waded towards the boat; and they remained at their station, without giving us any interruption. As soon as we were aboard we rowed abreast of them,- and their number then appeared to be between sixty and a hundred.

What these fires were, or for what purpose intended, we icould not imagine : those who discharged them had in their hands a short piece of stick, possibly a hollow cane, which they swung sideways from them, and we immediately saw fire and smoke, exactly resembling those of a musquet, and of no longer duration. This wonderful phaenomenon was observed from the ssiip, and the deception was so great that the people on board thought they had fire-arms ; and in the boat, if we had not been so near as that we must have heard the report, we should have thought they had been firing volleys. After we had looked at them attentively some time, without taking any notice of their stashing and vociferation, we sired some musquets over their heads: upon hearing the balls rattle among the trees, they walked leisurely away, and we returned to the ssiip. Upon examining the weapons they had thrown at us, we found them to be light darts, about four feet long, very ill made, of a reed or bamboo cane, and pointed with hard wood, in which there were many barbs. They were discharged with great force ; for though we were at sixty yards distance, they went beyond us, but in what manner we could not exactly fee: possibly they might be shot with a bow; but we saw no bows among them when we surveyed them from the boat, and we were in general of opinion that they were thrown with a stick, in the manner practised by the New Hollanders.

Soon after our return to the ship, we hoisted in the boat and made fail to the westward, being resolved to spend no more time upon this coast, to the great satisfaction of a very considerable majority of the ship's company. But I am sorry to fay that I was strongly urged by some of the officers to. send a party of men ashore, and cut down the cocoa-nut. trees for the fake of the fruit. This I peremptorily refused, as equally unjust and cruel. The natives had attacked us merely for landing upon their coast, when we attempted to> take nothing away, and it was therefore morally certain that they would have made a vigorous effort to defend their- property if it had been invaded, in which cafe many of them' must have fallen a sacrifice to our attempt, and perhaps also some of our own people. I should have regretted the necessity of such a measure, if I had been in want of the necessaries of life ; and certainly it would have been highly criminal when nothing was to be obtained but two or three hundred of green cocoa-nuts, which would at most have procured us a mere transient gratification. I might indeed have proceeded farther along the coast to the northward and' westward, in search of a place where the ship might have lain so near the shore as to cover the people with her guns when they landed; but this would have obviated only part of the mischief, and though it might have secured us, its would probably in the very act have been fatal to the natives.

The Spaniards indeed, as well as the Dutch, seem to have circumnavigated all the islands in New Guinea, as almost every place that is distinguished in the chart has a name in both languages. The charts with which I compared such part of this coast as I visited, are bound up with a French work, in- titled, \"Histoire des NavigationesauxTerres Australes,\" which was published in 1756, and I found them tolerably exact; yet I know not by whom, nor when they were taken: and though New Holland and New Guinea are in them represented as two distinct countries, the very history in which they are bound up, leaves it in doubt. I pretend however to no more merit in this part of the voyage, than to have established the fact beyond all controversy. As the two countries lie very near each other, and the intermediate space is full of islands, it is reasonable to suppose that they were both peopled from one common stock: yet no intercourse appears to have been kept up between them ; for if there had, the cocoa-nuts, bread-fruit, plantains, and other fruits of New Guinea, which are equally necessary for the support of life, would certainly have been transplanted to New Holland, where no traces of them are to be found.

If therefore it should appear, that the languages of New Britain and New Guinea are the fame, there will be reason to suppose that New Britain and New Guinea were peopled from a common stock; but that the inhabitants of New Holland had a different origin, notwithstanding, the proximity of the countries.

We were now well assured, *--v_-, that as the first land we had seen was Timor, the last island Tuesday we had pasted was Timor Laoet, or Laut. Laoet, is a word in the language of Malaca, signifying Sea, and this island was named by the inhabitants of that country. The south part of it lies in latitude 8° 15' 8. longitude 228° 10' W. but in the charts the south point is laid down in various latitudes, from 8° 30' to 9° 30': it is indeed possible that the land we saw might be some other island, but the presumption to the contrary is very strong, for if Timor Laut had lain where it is placed in the charts, we must have seen it there. We were now in latitude 9° 37' S.; longitude, by an observation of the sun and moon, 233® 54' W. we were the day before in 233° 27'; the difference is 27', exactly the same that was given by the log: this, however, is a degree of accuracy in observation that is seldom to be expected.

The land here answered well to the description that he has given of it: close to the beach it was covered with high spiry trees, which he mentions as having the appearance of pines; behind these there seemed to be salt water creeks, and many mangroves, interspersed however with cocoa-nut trees: the flat land at the beach appeared in some places to extend inward two or three miles before the rife of the first hill; in this part, however, we saw no appearance of plantations or houses, but great fertility, and from the number of fires, we judged that the place must be well peopled. When we had approached within a mile and an half of the shore, we tacked and stood off, and the extreams of the coast then extended from N. E. by E. to W. by 8. 4 S. The south westerly extremity was a low point, distant from us about three leagues. While we were standing in for the shore, we sounded several times, but had no ground till we came within about two miles and a half, and then we had five and twenty fathom, with a soft bottom.

The houses were shaded by groves of the fan palm, or borajsus , and the plantations, which were inclosed by a fence, reached almost to the tops of the highest hills.

LIEUTENANT COOK'S VOYAGE up N.N.W. in order to go between it and Semauafter steering three leagues upon this course, we edged away N.W. and W. and by six, we were clear of all the islands. At this time, the south part of Semau, which lies in latitude io° 15' 8. bore N.E. distant four leagues, and the island of Rotte extended as far to the southward as 8. 36 W. The north end of this island, and the south end of Timor, lie N. 4 E. and S. 4 W. and are about three or four leagues distant from each other. At the west end of the paslage between Rotte and Semau, are two small islands, one of which lies near the Rotte shore, and the other off the south west point of Semau: there is a good channel between them, about six miles broad, through which we passed. The isle of Rotte has not so lofty and mountainous an appearance as Timor, though it is agreeably diversified by hill and valley: on the north side, there are many sandy beaches, near which grew some trees of the fan palm, but the far greater part was covered with a kind of brushy wood, that was without leaves. The appearance of Semau was nearly the fame with that of Timor, but not quite so high. About ten o'clock at night, we observed a phaenomenon in the heavens, which in many particulars resembled the aurora borealis, and in others, was very different- it consisted of a dull reddish light, and reached about twenty degrees above the horizon: its extent was very different at different times, but it was never less than eight or ten points of the compass: through, and out of this, passed rays of light of a brighter colour, which vanished, and were renewed nearly in the same time as those of the aurora borealis, but had no degree of the tremulous or vibratory motion which is observed in that phaenomenon: the body of it bore 8,8.

Being clear of all the islands, which are laid down in the Monday 17 maps we had on board, between Timor and Java, we steered a west course till fix o'clock the next morning, when we unexpectedly saw an island bearing W.S.W. and at first I thought we had made a new discovery. We steered directly for it, and by ten o'clock were close in with the north side of it, where we saw houses, cocoa-nut trees, and, to our very agreeable surprise, numerous flocks of sheep. This was a temptation not to be resisted by people in our situation, especially as many of us were in a bad state of health, and many still repining at my not having touched at Timor: it was therefore soon determined to attempt a commerce with people who appeared to be so well able to supply our many necessities, and remove at once the sickness and discontent that had got footing among us. The pinnace was hoisted out, and Mr. Gore, the Second Lieutenant, sent to see if there was any convenient place to land, taking with him some trifles, as presents to the natives, if any of them ssiould appear. While he was gone, we saw from the ship two men on horseback, who seemed to be riding upon the hills for their amusement, and often stopped to look at the ship. By this we knew that the place had been settled by Europeans, and hoped, that the many disagreeable circumstances which always attend the first establishment of commerce with savages, would be avoided. In the mean time, Mr. Gore landed in a small sandy cove near some houses, and was met by eight or ten of the natives, who, as welkin their dress as their persons, very much resembled the Malays: they were without arms, except the knives which it is their custom to wear in their girdles, and one of them had a jack ass with him: they courteously invited him ashore, and con- Vol. III.

In a short time he returned with this report, and, to our great mortification, added, that there was no anchorage for the ihip. I sent him however a second time, with both money and goods, that he might, if possible, purchase some refreshments, at least for the sick; and Dr. Solander went in the boat with him. In the mean time I kept standing on and off with the ship, which at this time was within about a mile of the shore. Before the boat could land, we saw two other horsemen, one of whom was in a complete European dress, consisting of a blue coat, a white waistcoat, and a laced hat: these people, when the boat came to the'shore, took little notice of her, but sauntered about, and seemed to look with great curiosity at the ship. We saw however other horsemen, and a great number of persons on foot, gather round our people, and, to our great satisfaction, perceived several cocoa-nuts carried into the boat, from which we concluded that peace and commerce were established between us. After the boat had been ashore about an hour and a half, she made the signal for having intelligence that there was a bay to leeward, where we might anchor: we stood away directly for it, and the boat following, soon came on board. The Lieutenant told us, that he had seen some of the principal people, who were dressed in fine linen, and had chains- of gold round their necks: he said, that he had not been able to trade, because the owner of the cocoa-nuts was absent, but that about two dozen had been sent to the boat as a present, and that some linen had been accepted in return.

Some of 1770. them frequently pronounced the word Portuguese, and said something of Larntuca upon the island of Ende : from this Monda * 17 ' circumstance, we conjectured that there were Portuguese somewhere upon the istand, and a Portuguese, who was in our boat, attempted to converse with the Indians in that language, but soon found that they knew only a word or two of it by rote: one of them however, when they Were giving our people to understand that there was a town near the harbour to which they had directed us, intimated, that as a token of going right, we should see somewhat, which he expressed by crossing his fingers, and the Portuguese instantly conceived that he meant to express a cross. Just as our people were putting off, the horseman in the European dress came up, but the officer not having his commission about him, thought it best to decline a conference. At seven o'clock in the evening, we came to an anchor in the bay to which we had been directed, at about the distance of a mile from the shore, in thirty-eight fathom water, with a clear sandy bottom. The north point of the bay bore N. 30 E. distant two miles and an half, and the south point, or west end of the istand, bore 8. 63 W. Just as we got round the north point, and entered the bay, we discovered a large Indian town or village, upon which we stood on, hoisting a jack on the fore top-mast head: soon after, to our great surprize, Dutch colours were hoisted in the town, and three guns fired ; we stood on, however, till we had soundings, and then anchored.

As soon as he came ashore, he was received by a guard of between twenty and thirty Indians, armed with muskets who conducted him to the town, where the colours had been hoisted the night before, carrying with them those that had been hoisted upon the beach, and marching without any military regularity. As soon as he arrived, he was introduced to the Raja, or King of the island, and by a Portuguese interpreter, told him, that the ship was a man of war belonging to the King of Great Britain, and that she had many sick on board, for whom he wanted to purchase such refreshments as the island afforded. His Majesty replied, that he was willing to supply us with whatever we wanted, but, that being in alliance with the Dutch East India Company, he was not at liberty to trade with any other people, without having first procured their consent, for which, however, he said he would immediately apply to- a Dutchman who belonged to the company, and who was the only white man upon the island. To this man, who resided at some distance, a letter was immediately dispatched, acquainting him with our arrival and request: in the mean time, Mr. Gore dispatched a messenger to me, with an account of his situation, and the state of the treaty. In about three hours, the Dutch resident answered the letter that had been sent him, in person: he proved to be a native of Saxony, and his name is Johan Christopher Lange, and the same person whom we had seen on horseback in a European dress: he behaved with great civility to Mr. Gore, and assured him, that we were at liberty to purchase of the natives whatever we pleased.

About two o'clock, they all came aboard the ship, and our dinner being ready, they accepted our invitation to partake of it: I expected them immediately to sit down, but the King seemed to hesitate, and at last, with some confusion, said he did not imagine that we, who were white men, would suffer him, who was of a different colour, to sit down in our company ; a compliment soon removed his scruples, and we all fat down together with great cheerfulness and cordiality: happily we were at no loss for interpreters, both Dr. Solander and Mr. 8poring understanding Dutch enough to keep up a conversation with Mr. Lange, and several of the seamen were able to converse with such of the natives as spoke Portuguese. Our dinner happened to be mutton, and the King expressed a desire of having an English sheep; we had but one left, however that was presented to him: the facility with which this was procured, encouraged him to ask for an English dog, and Mr. Banks politely gave up his greyhound : Mr. Lange then intimated that a spying-glass would be acceptable, and one was immediately put into his hand. Our guests then told us that the island abounded with buffaloes, sheep, hogs, and fowls, plenty of which should be driven down to the beach the next day, that we might purchase as many of them as we should think fit: this put us all into high spirits, and the liquor circulated rather faster than either the Indians or the Saxon could bear; they intimated their desire to go away, however, before they were quite drunk, and were received upon deck, as they had been when they came aboard, by the marines under arms.

They were dismissed with many presents, and when they went away saluted with nine guns: Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander went ashore with them; and as soon as they put off they gave us three cheers. Our Gentlemen, when they came ashore, walked up with them to the town, which consists of many houses, and some of them are large; they are however nothing more than a thatched roof, supported over a boarded floor, by pillars about four feet high. They produced some of their palm- wine, which was the fresh unfermented juice of the tree; it had a sweet, but not a disagreeable taste; and hopes were conceived that it might contribute to recover our sick from the scurvy.

We were greatly mortified to find that no steps had been taken to fulfil this promise ; however, we proceeded to the house of assembly, which with two or three more had been erected by the Dutch East India company, and are distinguished from the rest by two pieces of wood resembling a pair of cow's horns, one of which is set up at each end of the ridge that terminates the roof; and these were certainly what the Indian intended to represent by crossing his fingers, though our Portuguese, who was a good Catholic, construed the sign into a cross,"}, {"page_label": "Seite 356", "page_text": "3 5 6 LIEUTENANT COOK's VOYAGE 1770.

Many of them are carpenters, joiners, smiths, taylors, flipper makers, dyers of cotton, and embroiderers ; maintaining the character of industry that is universally given of them: and some are scattered about the country, where they cultivate gardens, sow rice and sugar, or keep cattle and buffaloes, whose milk they bring daily to town. There is nothing clean or dirty, honest or dishonest, provided there is not too much danger of a halter, that the Chinese will not readily do for money. But though they work with great diligence, and patiently undergo any degree of labour; yet no sooner have they laid down their tools than they begin to game, either at cards or dice, or some other play among the multitude that they have invented, which are altogether unknown in Europe: to this they apply with such eagerness, as scarcely to allow time for the necessary refreshments of food and steep ; so that it is as rare to fee a Chinese idle, as it is to fee a Dutchman or an Indian employed. In manners they are always civil, or rather obsequious; and in dress they are remarkably neat and clean, to whatever rank of life they belong. I shall not attempt a de script lion either of their persons or habits, for the better kind of China paper, which is now common in England, exhibits a perfect representation of both, though perhaps with some flight exaggerations approaching towards the caricatura. In eating they are easily satisfied, though the few that are rich have many savory dishes. Rice, with a small proportion of flesh or fish, is the food of the poor; and they have greatly the advantage of the Mahometan Indians,, whose religion forbids them to eat of many things which they could most easily procure.

The Chinese have a singular superstition with regard to the burial of their dead; for they will upon no occasion open the ground a second time, where a body has been interred. Their burying grounds, therefore, in the neighbourhood of Batavia, cover many hundred acres, and the Dutch, grudging the waste of so much land, will not fell any for this purpose but at the most exorbitant price. The Chinese, however, contrive to raise the purchase money, and afford another instance of the folly and weakness of human nature, in transferring a regard for the living to the dead, and making that the object; of solicitude and expence, which cannot receive the least benefit from either. Under the influence of this universal prejudice, they take an uncommon method to preserve the body intire, and prevent the remains of it from being mixed with the earth that surrounds it. They inclose it in a large thick coffin of wood, not made of planks joined together, but hollowed out of the solid timber like a canoe; this being covered, and let down into the grave, is surrounded with a coat of their mortar, called Chinam, about eight or ten inches thick, which in a short time becomes as hard as a stone.

In this place we met Mr. Lange, and t SeFtembe _^ the King, whose name was A Madocho Lorai Djara, attended Wednes ' ** by many of the principal people. We told them that we had in the boat goods of various kinds, which we proposed to barter for such refreshments as they would give us in exchange, and desired leave to bring them on shore; which being granted, they were brought ashore accordingly. We then attempted to settle the price of the buffaloes, sheep, hogs, and other commodities which we proposed to purchase, and for which we were to pay in money ; but as soon as this was mentioned Mr. Lange left us, telling us that these preliminaries must be settled with the natives: he said, however, that he had received a letter from the Governor of Gon cord ia in Timor, the purport of which he would communicate to us when he returned.. As the morning was now far advanced, and we were very unwilling to return on board and eat salt provisions, when so many delicacies surrounded us ashore, we petitioned his Majesty for liberty to purchase a small hog and some rice, and to employ his subjects to dress them for us.

As he did not come, we enquired for him, and were told that the custom of the country did not permit the person who gave the entertainment to sit down with-his guests ; but that, if we suspected the victuals to be poisoned, he would come and taste it. We immediately declared that we had no such suspicion, and desired that none of the rituals of hospitality might be violated on our account. The prime minister and Mr. Lange were of our party, and we made a most luxurious meal: we thought the pork and rice excellent, and the broth not to be despised; but the spoons, which were made of leaves, were so small that few of us had patience to use them. After dinner, our wine passed briskly about, and we again enquired for our royal host, thinking that though the custom of his country would not allow him to eat with us, he might at least share in the jollity of our bottle ; but he again excused himself, saying, that the master of a feast should never be drunk, which there was no certain way to avoid but by not tasting the liquor. We did not however drink our wine where we had eaten our victuals; but as soon as we had dined made room for the seamen and servants, who immediately took our places: they could not dispatch all that we had left, but the women who came to clear away the bowls and bassets, obliged them to carry away with them what they had not eaten. As wine generally warms and opens the heart, we took an opportunity, when we thought its influence began to be felt, to revive the subject of the buffaloes and sheep, of which we had not in all this time heard a syllable, though they were to have been brought down early in the morning.

Every man who is able to keep house has a certain specific rank acquired by the length of his services to the company ; the different ranks which are thus acquired are distinguished by the ornaments of the coaches and the-dresses of the coachmen: some are obliged to ride in plain coaches, some are allowed to paint them in different manners and degrees, and'some to gild them. The coachman also appears in clothes that are quite plain, or more or less adorned with lace. The officer who presides here has the title of Governor General of the Indies, and the Dutch Governors of all the other settlements are subordinate to him, and obliged to repair to Batavia that he may pass their accounts. If they appear to have been criminal, or even negligent, he punishes them by delay, and detains them during pleasure, sometimes one year, sometimes two years, and sometimes three ; for they cannot quit the place till he gives them a dismission. Next to the Governor are the members of the council, called here Edele Heeren , and by the corruption of the English, Ido- leers. These Idoleers take upon them so much state that whoever meets them in a carriage, is expected to rife up and bow, then to drive on one side of the road, and there stop till they are past: the fame homage is required also to their wives and even their children; and it is commonly paid them by the inhabitants. But some of our Captains have thought so slavish a mark of respect beneath the dignity which they derived from the service of his Britannic Majesty, and have refused to pay it; yet, if they were in a hired carriage, nothing could deter the coachman from honouring the Dutch Grandee at their expence, but the most peremptory menace of immediate death.

It was the general opinion that this letter was a fiction; that the prohibitory orders were feigned with a view to get money from us for breaking them; and that by precluding our liberality to the natives, this man hoped more easily to turn it into another channel. In the evening, we received intelligence from our trading- place that no buffaloes or hogs had been brought down, and only a few sheep, which had been taken away before our people, who had sent for money, could procure it. Some fowls however had been bought, and a large quantity of a kind of syrup made of the juice of the palm-tree, which, though infinitely superior to molafles or treacle, fold at a very low price. We complained of our disappointment to Mr. Lange, who had now another subterfuge; he said, that if we had gone down to the beach ourselves, we might have purchased what we pleased; but that the natives were afraid to take money of our people, lest it should be counterfeit.

A messenger was immediately dispatched to his Majesty, who soon returned, and said, that the buffalo would not be sold for any thing less than five guineas.

Besides the officers who commanded the party, there came with it a man who was born at Timor, of Portuguese parents, and who, as we afterwards discovered, was a kind of colleague to the Dutch factor; by this man what they pretended to be the King's order was delivered to me, of the same purport with that which Dr. Solander had received from Lange. We were all clearly of opinion that this was a mere artifice of the factors to extort money from us, for which we had been prepared by the account of a letter from Concordia ; and while we were hesitating what step to take, the Portuguese, that he might the sooner accomplish his purpose, began to drive away the people who had brought down poultry and syrup, and others that were now coming in with buffaloes and ssieep.

To establish a trade for buffaloes, however, which I most wanted, I found it necessary to give ten guineas for two, one of which weighed no more than a hundred and sixty pounds; but I bought seven more much cheaper, and might afterwards have purchased as many as I pleased almost upon my own terms, for they were now driven down to the waterside in herds. In the first two that I bought so dear, Lange had certainly a share, and it was in hopes to obtain part of the price of others, that he had pretended we must pay for them in gold. The natives however fold what they afterwards brought down much to their satisfaction, without paying part of the price to him as a reward for exacting money from us. Most of the buffaloes that we bought, after our friend, the Prime Minister, had procured us a fair market, were fold for a musquet a-piece, and at this price we might have bought as many as would have freighted our ship. The refreshments which we procured here, consisted of nine buffaloes, six sheep, three hogs, thirty dozen of fowls, a few limes, and some cocoa-nuts; many dozen of eggs, half of which however proved to be rotten; a little garlic, and several hundred gallons of palm-syrup. .0 CHAP;"}, {"page_label": "Seite 366", "page_text": "LIEUTENANT CGOK's VOYAGE 1771.

When their curiosity was satisfied, they hired a large failing boat for two roupees, four shillings, which brought them back to the ship time enough to dine upon one of the small deer, weighing only forty pounds, which had been bought the day before, and proved to be very good and savory meat. We went on shore in the evening, to see how the people who were employed in wooding and watering went on, and were informed that an ax had been stolen. As the pasting over this fault might encourage the commission of others of the fame kind, application was immediately made to the King, who after some altercation promised that the ax should be restored in the morning; and kept his word, for it was brought to us by a man who pretended that the thief, being afraid of a discovery, had privately brought it and left it at his house in the night. We continued to purchase between two and three hundred weight of turtle in a day, besides fowls and other necessaries; and in the evening of the izth, having nearly completed our wood and water, Mr. Banks went ashore to take leave of his Majesty, to whom he had made several trifling presents, and at parting gave him two quires of paper, which he graciously received. They had much conversation, in the course of which his Majesty enquired, why the English did not touch there as they had been used to do.

The deer however served only for present use, for we could seldom keep one of them alive more than four and twenty hours after it was on board.

I have seen a very old one, in which it is called Sou, and confounded with Sandel Bosch. Rumphius mentions an island by the name of Saow ; and he also says that it is the same which the Dutch call Sandel Bosch: but neither is this ifland, nor Timor, nor Rotte, nor indeed any one of the islands that we have seen in these seas, placed within a reasonable distance of its true situation. It is about eight leagues long from east to west; but what is its breadth, I do not know, as I saw only the north side. The harbour in which we lay is called Seba, from the district in which it lies: it is on the north west side of the island, and well sheltered from the south west trade wind, but it lies open to the north west. We were told, that there were two other bays where ships might anchor ; that the best, called Timo, was on the south west side of the south east point: of the third we learnt neither the name nor situation. The sea-coast, in general, is low; but in the middle of the island there are hills of a considerable height.

The level ground next to the seaside was covered with cocoa-nut trees, and a kind of palm called Arecas ; and beyond them the hills, which rose in a gentle and regular ascent, were richly clothed, quite to the summit, with plantations of the fan palm, forming an almost impenetrable grove. How much even this prospect must be improved, when every foot of ground between the trees is covered with verdure, by maize, and millet, and in- dico, can scarcely be conceived but by a powerful imagination, not unacquainted with the stateliness and beauty of the trees that adorn this part of the earth. The dry season commences in March or April, and ends in October or November. The principal trees of this island, are the fan-palm, the cocoa-nut, tamarind, limes, oranges, and mangoes; and other vegetable productions are maize, Guinea corn, rice, millet, callevances, and water-melons. We saw also one sugar-cane, and a few kinds of European garden-stuff; particularly cellery, marjoram, fennel, and garlic. For the supply of luxury, it has betele, areca, tobacco, cotton, indico, and a small quantity of cinnamon, which seems to be planted here only for curiosity; and indeed we doubted whether it was the genuine plant, knowing that the Dutch are very careful not to trust the spices out of their proper islands. There are however several kinds of fruit, besides those which have been already mentioned ; particularly the sweet sop, which is well known to the West Indians, and a small oval fruit, called the Blimbi , both of which grow upon trees.

The buffaloes differ very considerably from the horned cattle of Europe in several particulars; their ears are much larger, their skins are almost without hair, their horns are curved towards each other, but together bend directly backwards, and they have no dewlaps. We saw several that were as big as a well grown European ox, and there must be some much larger; for Mr. Banks saw a pair of horns which measured from tip to tip three feet nine inches and an half, across their widest diameter four feet one inch and an half, and in the. whole sweep of their semicircle in front seven feet six inches and a half. It must however be observed, that a buffalo here of any given size, does not weigh above half as much as an ox of the same size in England: those that we guessed to weigh four hundred weight did not weigh more than two hundred and fifty ; the reason is, that so late in the dry season the bones are very thinly covered with flesh : there is not an ounce of fat in a whole carcass, and the flanks are literally nothing but skin and bone: the flesh however is well tasted and juicy, and I suppose better than the flesh of an English ox would be if he was to starve in this fun-burnt country.

The hogs, however, were some of the fattest we had ever seen, though, as we were told, their principal food is the outside husks of rice, and the palm syrup dissolved in water. The fowls are chiefly of the game breed, and large, but the eggs are remarkably small. Of the fish which the sea produces here, we know but little: turtles are sometimes found upon the coast, and are by these people, as well as all others, considered as a dainty.

The dress of both sexes consists of cotton cloth, which being died blue in the yarn, and not uniformly of the same shade, is in clouds or waves of that colour, and even in our eye had not an inelegant appearance. This cloth they manufacture themselves, and two^pieces, each about two yards long, and a yard and a half wide, make a dress: one of them is worn round the middle, and the other covers the upper part of the body : the lower edge of the piece that goes round the middle, the men draw pretty tight just below the fork, the upper edge of it is left loose, so as to form a kind of hollow belt, which serves them as a pocket to carry their knives, and other little implements which it is convenient to have about them. The other piece of cloth is passed through this girdle behind, and one end of it being brought over the left shoulder, and the other over the right, they fall down over the breast, and are tucked into the girdle before, so that by opening or closing the plaits, they can cover more or less of their bodies as they please ; the arms, legs, and feet are always naked. The difference between .the dress of the two sexes consists principally in the manner of wearing the waist-piece, for the women, instead of drawing the lower edge tight, and leaving the upper edge loose for a pocket, draw the upper edge tight, and let the lower edge fall as low as the knees, so as to form a petticoat; the body-piece, instead of being pasted through the girdle, is fastened under the arms, and cross the breast, with the utmost decency.

These people bore their testimony that the love of finery is a universal passion, for their ornaments were very numerous. Some of the better fort wore chains of gold round their necks, but they were made of plaited wire, and consequently were light and of little value; others had rings, which were so much worn that they seemed tossiave descended through many generations ; and one person had a silver- headed cane, marked with a kind of cypher, consisting of the Roman letters V, O, C, and therefore probably a present from the Dutch East India Company,, whose mark it is they have also ornaments made of beads,, which some wear round their necks as a solitaire^ and others, as bracelets, upon their wrists: these are common to both sexes, but the women have besides, strings or girdles of beads, which they wear round their waists, and which serve to keep up their petticoat.

The universality of this practice, which prevails among savages in all parts of the world, from the remotest limits of North America, to the islands in the South Seas, and which probably differs but little from the method of staining the body that was in use among the ancient inhabitants of Britain, is a curious subject of speculation *.

Upon this floor are placed other posts or pillars, that support a roof of sloping sides, which meet in a ridge at the top, like those of our barns: the eaves of this roof, which is thatched with palm leaves, reach within two feet of the floor, and over-hang it as much: the space within is generally divided lengthwise into three equal parts ; the middle part, or center, is inclosed by a partition of four sides, reaching about six feet above the floor, and one or two small rooms are also sometimes taken off from the sides, the rest of the space under the roof is open, so as freely to admit the air and the light: the particular uses of these different apartments, our short stay would not permit us to learn, except that the close room in the center was appropriated to the women. The food of these people consists of every tame animal in the country, of which the hog holds the first place in their estimation, and the horse the second ; next to the horse is the buffalo, next to the buffalo their poultry, and they prefer dogs and cats to sheep and goats.

The liquor is called dua, or duac, and both the syrup and sugar, gula. The syrup is prepared by boiling the liquor down in pots of earthen ware, till it is sufficiently inspissated ; it is not unlike treacle in appearance, but is somewhat .thicker, and has a much more agreeable taste: the sugar is of a reddish brown, perhaps the fame with the Jugatassugar upon the continent of India, and it was more agreeable to* our palates than any cane sugar, unrefined, that we had- ever tasted.

The common method of dressing food here is by boiling, and as fire-wood is very scarce, and the inhabitants have no other fuel, they make use of a contrivance to save it, that is not wholly unknown in Europe, but is seldom practised except in camps. They dig a hollow under ground, in a horizontal direction, like a rabbit burrow, about two yards long, and opening into a hole at each end, one of which is large and the other small: by the large hole the fire is put in, and the small one serves for a draught. The earth over this burrow is perforated by circular holes, which communicate with the cavity below; and in these holes are set earthen pots, generally about three to each fire, which are large in the middle, and taper towards the bottom, so that the fire acts upon a large part of their surface. Each of these pots generally contains about eight or ten gallons, and it is surprising to fee with how small a quantity of sire they may be kept boiling; a palm leaf, or a dry stalk, thrust in now and then, is sufficient: in this manner they boil all their victuals, and make all their syrup and sugar.

This operation they perform; by rolling up a small quantity of tobacco, and putting it into' one end of a 1 tube about six inches long, and as thick as .a* goose quill, which they make of a palm leaf.

The Raja of Seba, the principality in which we were ashore, seemed to have great authority, without much external parade or show, or much appearance of personal respect. He was about five and thirty years of age, and the fattest man we saw upon the whole island: he appeared to be of a dull phlegmatic disposition, and to be directed almost implicitly by the old man who, upon my presenting him with a sword, had procured us a fair market, in spight of the craft and avarice of the Dutch factors. The name of this person was Mannu Djarme, and it may reasonably be supposed that he was a man of uncommon integrity and abilities, as, notwithstanding his possession of power in the character of a favourite, he was beloved by the whole principality. If any difference arises among the people, it is settled by the Raja and his counsellors, without delay or appeal, and, as we were told, with the most solemn deliberation and impartial justice. We were informed by Mr. Lange, that the chiefs who had successively presided over the five principalities of this island, had lived for time immemorial in the strictest alliance and most cordial friendship with each other; yet he said the people were of a warlike disposition, and had always courageously defended themselves against foreign invaders. We were told also, that the island was able to raise, upon very short notice, 7300 fighting men, armed with muskets, spears, lances, and targets. Of this force, Laai was said to furnish 5600, Seba 2000, Regeeua 1500, Timo 8co, and Maslara 400.

September: How far this account of the martial prowess of the inhabitants of Savu may be true, we cannot take upon us to determine; but during our stay, we saw no appearance of it. We saw indeed in the town-house, or house of assembly, about one hundred spears and targets, which served to arm the people who were sent down to intimidate us at the trading place ; but they seemed to be the refuse of old armories, no two being of the same make or length, for some were six, and some sixteen feet long: we saw no lance among them, and as to the muskets, though they were clean on the outside, they were eaten into holes by the rust within; and the people themselves appeared to be so little acquainted with military discipline, that they marched like a disorderly rabble, every one having, instead of his target, a cock, some tobacco, or other merchandise of the like kind, which he took that opportunity to bring down to sell, and few or none of their cartridge boxes were furnished with either powder or ball, though a piece of paper was thrust into the hole to save appearances. We saw a few swivel guns and pateraros at the town-house, and a great gun before it; but the swivels and pateraros lay out of their carriages, and the great gun lay upon a heap of stones, almost consumed with rust, with the touch-hole downwards, possibly to conceal its size, which might perhaps be little less than that of the bore.

We could not discover that among these people there was September, , o r r \"--- j any rank of distinction between the Raja and the landowners : the land-owners were respectable in proportion to their possessions ; the inferior ranks consist of manufacturers, labouring poor, and staves. The staves, like the peasants in some parts of Europe, are connected with the estate, and both descend together: but though the land-owner can sell his stave, he has no other power over his person, not even to correct him, without the privity and approbation of the Raja. Some have five hundred of these staves, and some not half a dozen: the common price of them is a fat hog. When a great man goes out, he is constantly attended by two or more of them: one of them carries a sword or hanger, the hilt of which is commonly of silver, and adorned with large tassels of horse hair; and another carries a bag which contains betel, areca, lime, and tobacco. In these attendants consists all their magnificence, for the Raja himself has no other mark of distinction. The chief object of pride among these people, like that of a Welchman, is a long pedigree of respectable ancestors, and indeed a veneration for antiquity seems to be carried farther here than in any other country: even a house that has been well inhabited for many generations, becomes almost sacred, and few articles either of use or luxury bear so high a price as stones, which having been long fat upon, are become even and smooth: those who can purchase such stones, or are possessed of them by inheritance, place them round their houses, where they serve as feats for their dependants. Every Raja sets up in the principal town of his province, or nigree, a large stone, which serves as a memorial of his reign. In the principal town of Seba, where we lay, there are thirteen such stones, besides many fragments of others, which"}, {"page_label": "Seite 291", "page_text": "ROUND THE WORLD. which had been set up in earlier times, and arc, now mould- 1772. , - r r September. enng away: these monuments ieem to prove that tome 1 - kind of civil establishment here is of considerable antiquity. The last thirteen reigns in England make something more than 276 years. Many of these stones are so large, that it is difficult to conceive by what means they were brought to their present station, especially as it is the summit of a hill; but the world is full of memorials of human strength, in which the mechanical powers that have been since added by mathematical science, seem to be surpassed; and of such monuments there are not a few among the remains of barbarous antiquity in our own country, besides those upon Salisbury plain. These stones not only record the reigns of successive princes, but serve for a purpose much more extraordinary, and probably altogether peculiar to this country. When a Raja dies, a general feast is proclaimed throughout his dominions, and all his subjects assemble round these stones ; almost every living creature .that can be caught is then killed, and the feast lasts for a less or greater number of weeks or months, as the kingdom happens to be more or less furnished with live stock at the time; the stones serve for tables. When this madness is over, a fast must necessarily ensue, and the whole kingdom is obliged to subsist upon syrup and water, if it happens in the dry season, when no vegetables can be procured, till a new stock of animals can be raised from the few that have escaped by chance, or been preserved by policy from the general massacre, or can be procured from the neighbouring kingdoms.

We saw their machine for clearing cotton of its feeds, which is made upon the same principles as those in Europe, but is so small that it might be taken for a model, or a toy: it consists of two cylinders, like our round rulers, somewhat less than an inch in diameter, one of which, being turned round by a plain winch, turns the other by means of an endless worm ; and the whole machine is not more than fourteen inches long, and seven high: that which we saw had been much used, and many pieces of cotton were hanging about it, so that there is no reason to doubt its being a fair specimen of the rest. We also once saw their apparatus for spinning; it consisted of a bobbin, on which was wound a small quantity of thread* and a kind of distaff filled with cotton y we conjectured therefore that they spin by hand, as the women of Europe did before the introduction of wheels; and I am told that they have not yet found their way into some parts of it. Their loom seemed to be in one respect preferable to ours, for the web was not stretched upon a frame, but extended by a piece of wood at each end, round one of which the doth was rolled, and round the other the threads: the web was about half a yard broad, and the length of the shuttle was equal to the breadth of the web, so that probably their work goes on but stowly. That they dyed this cloth we first guessed from its colour, and from the indigo which we saw in their plantations; and our conjecture was afterwards confirmed by Mr. Lange's account.

In their morals, however, they are said to be irreproachable, even upon the principles of Christianity: no man is allowed more than one wife; yet an illicit commerce between the sexes is in a manner unknown among them: instances of theft are very rare; and they are so far from revenging a supposed injury by murder, that if any difference arises between them, they will not so much as make it the subject of debate, lest they should be provoked to resentment and ill-will, but immedi ately and implicitly refer it to the determination of their r King.

The boats in use here are a kind of proa. This island was settled by the Portuguese almost as soon as they first found their way into this part of the ocean; but they were in a short time supplanted by the Dutch. The Dutch however did not take possession of it, but only sent sloops to trade with the natives, probably for provisions to support the inhabitants of their spice islands, who applying themselves wholly to the cultivation of that important article of trade, and laying out all their ground in plantations, can breed few animals : possibly their supplies by this occasional traffic were precarious; possibly they were jealous of being supplanted in their turn ; but however that be, their East India Company, about ten years ago, entered into a treaty with the Rajas, by which the Company stipulated to furnish each of them with a certain quantity of silk, fine linen, cutlery ware, arrack and other articles, every year; and the Rajas engaged that neither they nor their subjects should trade with any person except the Company, without having first obtained their consent, and that they would admit a resident on behalf of the Company, to reside upon the island, and see that their part of the treaty was fulfilled: they also engaged to supply annually a certain quantity of rice, maize, and calevances. The maize and calevances are sent to Timor in sloops, which are kept there for that purpose, each of which is navigated by ten Indians; and the rice is fetched away annually by a ship which brings the Company's returns, and anchors alternately in each of the three bays. These returns are delivered to the Rajas in the form of a present, and the cask of arrack they and their principal people 7"}, {"page_label": "Seite 295", "page_text": "295 ROUND THE WORLD. people never cease to drink, as long as a drop of it remains. In consequence of this treaty, the Dutch placed three persons upon the island: Mr. Lange, his colleague, the native of Timor, the son of an Indian woman by a Portuguese, and one Frederick Craig, the son of an Indian woman by a Dutchman. Lange visits each of the Rajas once in two months, when he makes the tour of the island, attended by fifty slaves on horseback. He exhorts these Chiefs to plant, if it appears that they have been remiss, and observes where the crops are got in, that he may order sloops to fetch it; so that it passes immediately from the ground to the Dutch storehouses at Timor. In these excursions he always carries with him some bottles of arrack, which he finds, of great use in opening the hearts of the Rajas with whom he is to deal. During the ten years that he had resided upon this island he had never seen a European besides ourselves, except at the arrival of the Dutch ship, which had failed about two months before we arrived ; and he is now to be distinguished from the natives only by his colour and his dress, for he sits upon the ground, chews his betele, and in every respect has adopted their character and manners; he has married an Indian woman of the island of Timor, who keeps his house after the fashion of her country; and he gave that as a reason for not inviting us to visit him, saying, that he could entertain us in no other manner than the Indians had done, and he spoke no language readily but that of the. country.

Dr. September^ Colander, who was at his house, saw the books, and the copybooks also, of his scholars, many of whom wrote a very fair hand. He boasted that there were no less than six hundred Christians in the township of Seba ; but what the Dutch Christianity of these Indians may be, it is not perhaps very easy to guess, for there is not a church, nor even a priest, in the whole island. While we were at this place, we made several enquiries concerning the neighbouring islands, and the intelligence which we received is to the following effect: A small island to the westward of Savu, the name of which we did not learn, produces nothing of any consequence but areca-nuts, of which the Dutch receive annually the freight of two sloops, in return for presents that they make to the islanders. Timor is the chief, and the Dutch residents on the other islands go thither once a year to pass their accounts. The place is nearly in the fame state as in Dampier's time, the Dutch having there a fort and storehouses ; and by Lange's account we might there have been supplied with every necessary that we expected to procure atBatavia, salt provisions and arrack not excepted. But the Portuguese are still in possession of several towns on the north side of the island, particularly Laphao and Sesial. About two years before our arrival, a French ship was wrecked upon the east coast of Timor ; and after she had lain some days upon the shoal, a sudden gale broke her up at once, and drowned the Captain, with the greatest part of the crew: those who got ashore, among whom was one of the Lieutenants, made the best of their way to Concordia; they were four days upon the road, where they were obliged"}, {"page_label": "Seite 297", "page_text": "ROUND THE WORLD. 2 97 iiged to leave part of their company through fatigue, and 177°* the rest, to the number of about eighty, arrived at the town. v!!- They were supplied with every necessary, and sent back to the wreck, with proper assistance, for recovering what could be fissied up: they fortunately got up all their bullion, which was in chests, and several of their guns, which were very large. They 'then returned to the town, but their companions who had been left upon the road were missing, having, as it was supposed, been kept among the Indians, either by persuasion or*force; for they are very desirous of having Europeans among them, to instruct them in the art of war. After a stay of more than two months at Concordia, their number was diminished nearly one half by sickness, in consequence of the fatigue and hardship which they had suffered by the shipwreck, and the survivors were sent in a small vessel to Europe.

Formerly it was made only by bruising, the canes, and boiling the juice to a syrup, in the same manner as Toddy ; but great improvements have lately been made in preparing this valuable commodity. The three little islands called the Solars are also under the influence of the Dutch settlement at Concordia: they are flat and low, but abound with provisions of every kind, and the middlemost is said to have a good harbour for shipping. Ende, another little island to the westward of the Solars, is still in the hands of the Portuguese, who have a good town and harbour on the north east corner of it called Larntuca : they had formerly an harbour on the south side of it, but that, being much inferior to Larntuca, has for some time been altogether neglected.

If they spoke a common language, they would learn, by a mutual intercourse with each other, to plant such things as would be of more value to themselves than their present produce, though of less advantage to the Dutch ; but their languages being different, they can communicate no such knowlege to each other, and the Dutch % secure to themselves the benefit of supplying their several neceffities upon their own terms, which it is reasonable to suppose are not very moderate. It is probably with a view to this advantage that the Dutch never teach their own language to the natives of these islands, and have been at the expence of translating the Testament and catechisms into the different languages of each ; for in proportion as Dutch had become the language of their religion, it would have become the common language of them all. To this account of Savu, I shall only add a small specimen of its language, by which it will appear to have some affinity with that of the South Sea islands, many of the words being exactly the same, and the numbers manifestly derived from the same source.

In the mean time, I sent a Lieutenant ashore to acquaint the Governor of our arrival, and to make an excuse for our not saluting; for as I could salute with only three guns, except the swivels, which I was of opinion would not be heard, I thought it was better to let it alone. As soon as the boat was dispatched the carpenter delivered me an account of the defects of the ship, of which the following is a copy: * c The defects of his Majesty's bark Endeavour, Lieutenant \" James Cook Commander. \" The ship very leaky, as she makes from twelve to six \" inches water an hour, occasioned by her main keel being \" wounded in many places, and the scarfs of her stern being \" very open: the false keel gone beyond the midships from \" forward, and perhaps farther, as I had no opportunity of \" seeing for the water when hauled ashore for repairing: \" wounded on the larboard side under the main channel, \" where I imagine the greatest leak is, but could not come \" at it for the water: one pump on the larboard side useless; \" the others decayed within an inch and an half of the bore. \" Otherwise masts, yards, boats, and hull, in pretty good \" condition.\" As it was the universal opinion that the ship could not safely proceed to Europe without an examination of her bottom, I determined to apply for leave to heave her down at this place; and as I understood that it would be necessary to make this application in writing, I drew up a request, and Qjl 2 the"}, {"page_label": "Seite 308", "page_text": "LIEUTENANT COOK's VOYAGE the next morning, having got it translated into Dutch, we all went ashore. We repaired immediately to the house of Mr. Leith, the only Englishman of any credit who is resident at this place ; he received us with great politeness, and engaged us to dinner : to this gentleman we applied for instructions how to provide ourselves with lodgings and necessaries while we should stay ashore, and he told us, that there was a hotel, or kind of inn, kept by the order of government, where all merchants and strangers were obliged to reside, paying half per cent upon the value of their goods for warehouse room, which the master of the house was obliged to provide ; but that as we came in a King's ship, we should be at liberty to live where we pleased, upon asking the Governor's permission, which would be granted of course. He said,, that it would be cheaper for us to take a house in the town, and bring our own servants ashore, if we had any body upon whom we could depend to buy in our provisions; but as this was not the cafe, having no person among us who could speak the Malay language, our gentlemen determined to go to the hotel. At the hotel, therefore, beds were immediately hired, and word was sent that we should sleep there at night. At five o'clock in the afternoon, I was introduced to the Governor-General, who received me very courteously; he told me, that I should have every thing I wanted, and that in the morning my request should be laid before the coun- cil, which I was desired to attend.

This ship lay not more than the distance of two cables' length from ours, and in all probability we should have shared the same fate, but for the electrical chain which we had but just got up, and which conducted the lightning over the side of the ship; but though we escaped the lightning, the explosion shook us like an earthquake, the chain at tile same time appearing like a line of fire: a centinel was in the action of charging his piece, and the shock forced the musket out of his hand, and broke the rammer rod. Upon this occasion, I cannot but earnestly recommend chains of the fame kind to every ship, whatever be her destination, and I hope that the fate of the Dutchman will be a warning to all who shall read this narrative, against having an iron spindle at the masthead. The next morning, I attended at the council-chamber, and was told that I should have every thing I wanted. In the mean time, the gentlemen ashore agreed with the keeper of the hotel for their lodging and board, at the rate of two rix- dollars, or nine drillings sterling a day for each ; and as there were five of them, and they would probably have many visitors from the ship, he agreed to keep them a separate table, upon condition that they should pay one rix-dollar for the dinner of every stranger, and another for his supper and bed, if he should sleep ashore. Under this stipulation they were to be furnished with. tea, coffee, punch, pipes and tobacco, for themselves and their friends, as much as they could consume; they were also to pay half a rupee, or one drilling and three pence a day for each of their servants.

Their dinner consisted of one course ' of fifteen dishes, and their supper of one course of thirteen, but nine or ten of them consisted of bad poultry, variously dressed, and often served up the second, third, and even the fourth time : the same duck having appeared more than once roasted, found his way again to the table as a fricasee, and a fourth time in the form of forced meat. It was not long, however, before they learnt that this treatment was only by way of essay, and that it was the invariable custom of the house, to supply all strangers, at their first coming, with such fare as could be procured for the least money, and consequently would produce the most gain: that if either through indolence or good-nature they were content, it was continued for the benefit of the host, but that if they complained, it was gradually amended till they were satisfied, which sometimes happened before they had the worth of their money. After this discovery, they remonstrated, and their fare became better; however, after a few days, Mr. Banks hired a little house, the next door on the left hand to the hotel, for himself and his party, for which he paid after the rate of ten rix-dollars, or two pounds five shillings sterling a month; but here they were very far from having either the convenience or the privacy which they expected; no person was permitted to sleep in this private house occasionally, as a guest to the person who hired it, under a penalty, but almost every Dutchman that went by ran in without any ceremony, to ask what they fold, there having been very seldom any private persons at Batavia who had not something to sell.

He soon came ashore, with his boy Tayeto, and though while he was on board, and after he came into the boat, he was exceedingly listless and dejected, he no sooner entered the town than he seemed to be animated with a new soul. The houses, carriages, streets, people, and a multiplicity of other objects, all new, which rushed upon him at once, produced an effect like the sudden and secret power that is imagined of fascination. Tayeto expressed his wonder and delight with still less restraint, and danced along the street in a kind of extasy, examining every object with a restless and eager curiosity, which was every moment excited and gratified. One of the first things that Tupia remarked, was the various dresles of the pasting multitude, concerning which he made many enquiries; and when he was told that in this place, where people of many different nations were assembled, every one wore the habit of his country, he desired that he might conform to the custom, and appear in that of Otaheite. South Sea cloth was therefore sent for from the strip, and he equipped himself with great expedition and dexterity. The people who had seen Otourou, the Indian who had been brought hither by M. Bougainville, enquired whether Tupia was not the same personfrom these enquiries, we learnt who it was that we had supposed to be Spaniards, from the accounts that had been given of two ships by the Islanders.

Thursday 18. On the i8th, as soon as it was light, having by several accidents and mistakes suffered a delay of many days, I took up the anchor, and ran down to Ourust: a few days afterwards, we went along-side of the wharf, on Cooper's Island, • which lies close to Ourust, in order to take out our stores. By this time, having been here only nine days, we began to feel the fatal effects of the climate and situation. Tupia, after the stow of spirits which the novelties of the place produced upon his first landing, funk on a sudden, and grew every day worse and worse. Tayeto was seized with an inflammation upon his lungs, Mr. Banks's two servants became very ill, and himself and Dr. Solander were attacked by fevers: in a few days, almost every person both on board and ashore was sick; affected, no doubt, by the low swampy situation of the place, and the numberless dirty canals which intersect the town in all directions. On the 26th, I set up the tent for the reception of the ship's company, of whom there was but a small number able to do duty. Boor Tupia, of whose life we now began to despair, and who till this time had continued ashore with Mr. Banks, desired to be removed to the ship, where, he said, he should breathe a freer air than among the numerous houses which obstructed it ashore:"}, {"page_label": "Seite 313", "page_text": "ROUND THE WORLD. 3 13 ashore: on board the ship, however, he could not go, for she * 770 . was unrigged, and preparing to be laid down at the careen- \" - :r '_. ing-place; but on the 28th, Mr. Banks went with him to Sunday 28. Cooper's Island, or, as it is called here, Kuypor, where she lay, and as he seemed pleased with the spot, a tent was there pitched for him : at this place, both the sea breeze and the land breeze blew directly over him, and he expressed great satisfaction in his situation. Mr. Banks, whose humanity kept him two days with this poor Indian, returned to the town on the 30th, and the fits of his intermittent, which Tuesday 30. was now become a regular tertian, were so violent as to deprive him of his senses while they lasted, and leave him so weak that he was scarcely able to crawl down stairs: at this time, Dr. Solander's disorder also increased, and Mr. Monk- house, the Surgeon, was confined to his bed. On the 5th of November, after many delays in consequence of the Dutch ships coming along-side the wharfs to joad pepper, the ship was laid down, and the fame day, Mr. Monkhoufe, our Surgeon, a sensible, skilful man, fell the first sacrifice to this fatal country, a loss which was greatly aggravated by our situation. Dr. Solander was just able to attend his funeral, but Mr. Banks was confined to his bed. Our distress was now very great, and the prospect before us discouraging in the highest degree: our danger was not such as we could surmount by any efforts of our own ; courage, skill, and diligence were all equally ineffectual, and death was every day making advances upon us, where we could neither resist nor fly. Malay servants were hired to attend the sick, but they had so little sense either of duty or humanity, that they could not be kept within call, and the patient was frequently obliged to get out of bed to seek them.

Friday 9. In the mean time, the bottom of the ship being examined, was found to be in a worse condition than we apprehended: the false keel was all gone to within twenty feet of the stern post; the main keel was considerably injured in many places ; a great quantity of the sheathing was torn off, and several planks were much damaged ; two of them, and the half of a third, under the main channel near the keel, were, for the length of six feet, so worn, that they were not above an eighth part of an inch thick, and here the worms had made their way quite into the timbers; yet in this condition she had failed many hundred leagues, where navigation is as dangerous as in any part of the world: how much misery did we escape, by being ignorant that so considerable a part of the bottom of the vessel was thinner than the sole of a shoe, and that every life on board depended upon so flight and fragile a barrier between us and the unfathomable ocean !

At this place they heave down by two masts, a method which we do not now practise; it is, however, unquestionably more safe and expeditious to heave down with two masts than one, and he must have a good share of bigotry to old customs, and an equal want of common sense, who will not allow this, after seeing with what facility the Dutch heave down their largest ships at this place.

Upon these terms we parted, and soon aster I received a letter from Mr. Hicks, containing indubitable proof that the seaman in question was a subject of his Britannic Majesty. This letter I immediately carried to the Shebander, with a request that it might be shewn to the Governor, and that his Excellency might at the same time be told, I would not upon any terms part with the man.

'---' B ATAVIA, the capital of the Dutch dominions in India, and generally supposed to have no equal among all the possessions of the Europeans in Asia, is situated on the north side of the island of Java, in a low fenny plain, where several small rivers, which take their rife in the mountains called Blaeuwen Berg, about forty miles up the country, empty themselves into the sea, and where the coast forms a large bay, called the Bay of Batavia, at the distance of about eight leagues from the streight of Sunda. It lies in latitude 6 ° 10 ' S. and longitude 106° 50' E. from the meridian of Greenwich, as appears from astronomical observations made upon the spot, by the Reverend Mr. Mohr, who has built an elegant observatory, which is as well furnissied with instruments as most in Europe. The Dutch seem to have pitched upon this spot for the convenience of water-carriage, and in that it is indeed a second Holland, and superior to every other place in the world. There are very few streets that have not a canal of considerable breadth running through them, or rather stagnating in them, and continued for several miles in almost every direction beyond the town, which is also intersected by five or six rivers, some of which are navigable thirty or forty miles up the country.

Valentyn, who wrote an account of it about the year 1726, fays, that in his time there were, within the walls, 1242 Dutch houses, and 1200 Chinese; and without the walls 1066 Dutch, and 1240 Chinese, besides 12 arrack houses, making in all 4760: but this account appeared to us • tQ be greatly exaggerated, especially with respect to the number of houses within the walls. The streets are spacious and handsome, and the banks of the canals are planted with rows of trees, that make a very pleasing appearance ; but the trees concur with the canals to make the situation unwholesome. The stagnant canals in the dry season exhale an intolerable stench, and the trees impede the course of the air, by which in some degree the putrid effluvia would be dissipated. In the wet season the inconvenience is equal, for then these reservoirs of corrupted water overflow their banks in the lower part of the town, especially in the neighbourhood of the hotel, and sill the lower stories of the houses, where they leave behind them an inconceivable quantity of slime and filth: yet these canals are sometimes cleaned; but the cleaning them is so managed as to become as great a nuisance as the foulness of the water; for the black mud that is taken from the bottom is suffered to lie upon the banks, that is, in the middle of the street, till it has acquired a sufficient degree of hardness to be made the lading of a boat, and carried away. As this mud consists chiefly of human ordure, which is regularly thrown into the canals every morning, there not being a necessary-ho'use in the whole town, it poisons the air while it is drying to a considerable extent.

While we were here, a dead buffalo lay upon the shoal of a river that ran through one of the principal streets above a week, and at last was carried away by a stood. The houses are in general well adapted to the climate; they consist of one very large room or hall on the ground floor, with a door at each end, both which generally stand open: at one end a room is taken off by a partition, where the master of the house transacts his business ; and in the middle between each end there is a court, which gives light to the hall, and at the fame time increases the draught of air. From one corner of the hall the stairs go up to the floor above, where also the rooms are spacious and airy.

The public buildings are, most of them, old, heavy, and ungraceful; but the new church is not inelegant; it is built with a dome, that is seen from a great distance at sea, and though the outside has rather a heavy appearance, the inside forms a very sine room: it is furnished with an organ of a proper size, being very large, and is most magnificently illuminated by chandeliers. The town is inclosed by a stone wall, of a moderate height; but the whole of it is old, and many parts are much out of repair. This wall itself is surrounded by a river, which in some places is fifty, and in some a hundred yards wide : the stream is rapid, but the water is shallow. The wall is also lined within by a canal, which in different parts is of different breadths; so that, in pasting either out or in through the ft Zates,"}, {"page_label": "Seite 323", "page_text": "round the world. gates, it is necessary to cross two draw-bridges; and there is no access for idle people or strangers to walk upon the ramparts, which seem to be but ill provided with guns. In the north east corner of the town stands the castle or citadel, the walls of which are both higher and thicker than those of the town, especially near the landing-place, where there is depth of water only for boats, which it completely commands, with several large guns that make a very good appearance. Within this castle are apartments for the Governor General, and all the Council of India, to which they are enjoined to repair in cafe of a siege. Here are also large storehouses, where great quantities of the Company's goods are kept, especially those that are brought from Europe, and where almost all their writers transact their business. In this place also are laid up a great number of cannon, whether to mount upon the walls or furnish shipping, we could not learn ; and the Company is said to be well supplied with powder, which is dispersed in various magazines, that if some should be destroyed by lightning, which in this place is very frequent, tne rest may escape. Besides the fortifications of the town, numerous forts are dispersed about the country to the distance of twenty or thirty miles; these seem to have been intended merely to keep the natives in awe, and indeed they are fit for nothing else. For the same purpose a kind of houses, each of which mounts about eight guns, are placed in such situations as command the navigation of three or four canals, and consequently the roads upon their banks: some of these are in the town itself, and it was from one of these that all the best houses belonging to the Chinese were levelled with the ground in the Chinese rebellion of 1740.

Of one of these singular forts, or fortified houses, we should have procured a drawing, if our Gentlemen had not been confined by sickness almost all the time they were upon the island.

But if it is difficult to attack Batavia by land, it is utterly' impossible to attack it by sea: for the water is so shallow, that it will scarcely admit a longboat to come within cannon shot of the walls, except in a narrow channel, called the river, that is walled on both sides by strong piers, and runs about half a mile into the harbour. At the other end, it terminates under the fire of the strongest part of the castle ; and here its communication with the canals that intersect the' town is cut off by a large wooden boom, which is shut every night at six o'clock, and upon no pretence opened till the next morning. The harbour of Batavia is accounted the finest in India, and to all appearance with good reason; it is large enough to contain any number of ships, and the ground is so good that one anchor will hold till the cable decays: it never admits any sea that is troublesome, and its only inconvenience is the shoal water between the road and the river. When the sea breeze blows fresh, it makes a cockling sea that is dangerous to boats: our longboat once struck- two or three times as she was attempting to come out, and regained the river's mouth with some difficulty. A Dutch boat, laden with sails and rigging for one of the Indiamen\" was entirely lost. Round the harbour, on the outside, lie many islands, which < the Dutch have taken possession of, and apply to different uses. To one of them, called Edam, they transport all Europeans^ Z25- 1770.

At the distance of about forty miles inland there are hills of a considerable height, where, as we were informed, the air is healthy, and comparatively cool. Here the vegetables of Europe flourish in great perfection, particularly strawberries, which can but ill bear heat; and the inhabitants are vigorous and ruddy. Upon these hills some of the principal people have country houses, which they visit once a-year; and one was begun for the Governor, upon the plan of Blenheim, the famous seat of the Duke of Al a rl borough in Oxfordshire, but it has never been finished. To these hills also people are sent by the physicians, for the recovery of their health, and the effects of the air are said to be almost miraculous: the patient grows well in a short time, but constantly relapses soon after his return to Batavia. But the same situation and circumstances which render Batavia and the country round it unwholesome, render it the best gardener's ground in the world. The foil is fruitful beyond imagination, and the conveniences and luxuries of life that it produces are almost without number. Rice, which is well known to be the corn of these countries, and to serve the inhabitants instead of bread, grows in great plenty : and I must here observe, that in the hilly parts of Java, and in many of the eastern islands, a species of this grainjs planted, which in the western parts of India is entirely unknown. It is called by the natives Paddy Gunung , or Mountain rice; this, contrary to the other fort which must be under water three parts in four of the time of its growth, is planted upon the sides of hills where no water but rain can come: it is however planted at the beginning of the rainy season, and reaped in the beginning of the dry.

Z2Y bread corn is grown, it may perhaps be worth while to enquire. Indian corn, or maize, is also produced here; which the inhabitants gather when young, and toast in the ear. Here is also a great variety of kidney beans, and lentiles, which they call Cadjang> and which make a considerable part of the food of the common people; besides millet, yams both wet and dry, sweet potatoes, and European potatoes, which are very good, but not cultivated in great plenty. In the gardens, there are cabbages, lettuces, cucumbers, rhadishes, the white rhadishes of China, which boil almost as well as a turnep; carrots, parsley, celery, pigeon peas, the egg plant, which broiled, and eaten with pepper and salt, is very delicious ; a kind of greens resembling spinnage ; onions, very small, but excellent; and asparagus: besides some European plants of a strong smell, particularly sage, hysop, and rue. Sugar is also produced here in immense quantities: very great crops of the finest and largest canes that can be imagined are produced with very little care, and yield a much larger proportion of sugar than the canes of the West Indies. White sugar is fold here at two pence half-penny a pound ; and the molasses makes the arrack, of which, as of rum, it is the chief ingredient; a small quantity of rice, and some cocoa-nut wine, being added, chiefly, I suppose, to give it flavour. A small quantity of indigo is also produced here, not as an article of trade, but merely for home consumption. But the most abundant article of vegetable luxury here, is the fruit ; of which there is no less than six and thirty different kinds, and I shall give a very brief account of each. i.

They are very juicy and well flavoured ; but we all agreed that we had eaten as good from a hot-houfe in England: they are however so luxuriant in their growth that most of them have two or three crowns, and a great number of suckers from the bottom of the fruit; of these Mr. Banks once counted nine, and they are so forward that very often while they still adhered to the parent plant they shot out their fruit, which, by the time the large one became ripe, were of no inconsiderable size. We several times saw three upon one apple, and were told that a plant once produced a cluster of nine, besides the principal: this. indeed was considered as so great a curiosity, that it was preserved in sugar, and sent to the Prince of Orange. 2. Sweet oranges. These are very good, but while we were here, sold for six pence a piece; 3. Pumplemoeses, which in the West Indies are called' Shaddocks. These were well flavoured, but not juicy; their want of juice however was an accidental effect of the season. 4. Lemons. These were very scarce; but the want of them was amply compensated by the plenty of limes. 5. Limes. These were excellent, and to be bought at about twelve pence a hundred. We saw only two or three Seville oranges, which were almost all rind; and there are many forts, both of oranges and lemons, which I shall not particularly mention, because they are neither esteemed by Europeans nor the natives themselves. 6 Mangos.

The climate here, we were told, is too hot and damp for them ; but there are as many forts of them as there are of apples in England, and some are much superior to others. One fort, which is called Mangha Convani , has so strong a smell that a European can scarcely bear one in the room; these, however, the natives are fond of. The three forts which are generally preferred, are the Mangha Doodool t the Mangha Santock, and the Mangha Gure. 7. Bananes. Of these also there are innumerable forts, but three only are good; the Pijsang Alas, the Pijsang Radja, and the Pijsang Ambon : all these have a pleasant vinous taste, and the rest are useful in different ways ; some are fried in batter, and others are boiled and eaten as bread. There is one which deserves the particular notice of the botanist, because, contrary to the nature of its tribe, it is full of feeds, and is therefore called Pijsang Batu, or PJJang Bidjie ; it has however no excellence to recommend it to the taste, but the Malays use it as a remedy for the flux. 8. Grapes. These are not in great perfection, but they are very dear; for we could not buy a moderate bunch for less than a shilling or eighteen pence. 9. Tamarinds. These are in great plenty, and very cheap: the people however do not put them up in the manner practised by the West Indians, but cure them with salt, by which means they become a black mass, so disagreeable to the sight and taste, that few Europeans chuse to meddle with them. 10.

These are beyond comparison she most useful fruit that can be carried to sea; for they will keep without any care several months, and with sugar and lemon- juice, make a pye that can scarcely be distinguished from one made of the best apples ; and with pepper and fair, they are a substitute for turneps, not to be despised. 12. Papaws. This fruit when it is ripe is full of feeds, and almost without flavour; but if when it is green it is pared,, and the core taken out, it is better than the best turnep. 33. Guava. This fruit is much commended by the inhabitants of our islands in the West Indies, who probably have a better fort than we met with here, where the smell of them was so disagreeably strong that it made some of us sick those who tasted them, said, that the flavour was equally rank. 14. Sweet sop. The Annona squammosa of Linnaeus. This is also a West Indian fruit; it consists only of a mass of large kernels, from which a small proportion of pulp may be sucked, which is very sweet, but has little flavour. 15. Custard apple. The Annona reticulata of Linnaeus. The quality of this fruit is well expressed by its English name, which it acquired in the West Indies; for it is as like a custard, and a good one too, as can be imagined. 1 6 . The cashew apple. This is seldom eaten on account of its astringency. The nut that grows upon the top of it is well known in Europe. 17. The cocoa-nut. This is also well known in Europe; there are several sorts, but the best of those we found here is called Callappi Edjou., and is easily known by the redness of the flesh between the skin and the shell. 18.

To Europeans it is generally disagreeable at first; for in taste, it somewhat resembles a mixture of cream, sugar, and onions; and in the smell, the onions predominate. 24. Nanca. This fruit, which in some parts of India is called Jack, has, like the Durion, a smell very disagreeable to strangers, and somewhat resembling that of mellow apples mixed with garlic: the flavour is not more adapted to the general taste. In some countries that are favourable to it, it is said to grow to an immense size. Rumphius relates, that it is sometimes so large that a man cannot easily lift it; and we were told by a Malay, that at Madura it is sometimes so large as not to be carried but by the united efforts of two men.

Besides these, the island of Java, and particularly the country round Batavia, produces many kinds of fruit which were not in season during our stay; we were also told that apples, strawberries, and many other fruits from Europe, had been planted up in the mountains, and flourished there in great luxuriance.

These and some others do not merit to be particularly mentioned. The quantity of fruit that is consumed at Batavia is incredible; but that which is publicly exposed to sale is generally over-ripe.

This street is inhabited by none but Chinese fruit-sellers, who are supplied from the gardens of Gentlemen in the neighbourhood of the town, with such as is fresh, and excellent in its kind, for which however they must be paid more than four times the market price. The town in general is supplied from a considerable distance, where great quantities of land are cultivated merely for the production of fruit. The country people, to whom these lands belong, meet the people of the town at two great markets; one on Monday, called Pastar Sineen ; and the other on Saturday, called Pastar Tanabank. These fairs are held at places considerably distant from each other, for the convenience of different districts ; neither of them however are more than five miles distant from Batavia. At these fairs, the best fruit may be bought at the cheapest rate ; and the sight of them to a European is very entertaining. The quantity of fruit is astonishing; forty or fifty cart loads of the finest pine apples, packed as carelessly as turneps in England, are common, and other fruit in the same profusion. The days however on which these markets are held are ill contrived; the time between Saturday and Monday is too short, and that between Monday and Saturday too long: great part of what is bought on Monday is always much the worse for keeping before a new stock can be bought, either by the retailer or consumer; so that for several days in every week there is no good fruit in the hands of any people but the Chinese in Pastar Piffang. The inhabitants of this part of India practise a luxury which seems to be but little attended to in other countries; they are continually burning aromatic woods and resins, and scatter odours round them in a profusion of flowers, possibly as an antidote to the noisome effluvia of their ditches Vol. III.

The heat of this climate is so great, that few flowers exhale their sweets in the day; and this in particular, from its total want of scent at that time, and the modesty of its colour, which is white, seems negligent of attracting admirers, but as soon as night comes on, it diffuses its fragrance, and at once compels the attention, and excites the complacency of all who approach it. These are all sold about the streets every evening at sunset, either strung upon a thread, in wreaths of about two feet long, or made up into nosegays of different forms, either of which may be purchased for about a halfpenny. Besides these, there are, in private gardens, many other sweet flowers, which are not produced in a sufficient quantity to be brought to market. With a mixture of these flowers, and the leaves of a plant called pandang , cut into small pieces, persons of both sexes fill their hair and their clothes, and with the same mixture indulge a much higher luxury by strewing it on their beds, so that the chamber in which they steep, breathes the richest and purest of all odours, unallayed by the fumes which cannot but arise'where the steeper lies under two or three blankets and a quilt, for the bed covering here is nothing more than a single piece of fine chintz. Before I close my account of the vegetable productions of this part of India, I must take some notice of the spices. Java originally produced none but pepper. This is now sent from hence into Europe to a great value, but the quantity consumed here is very small: the inhabitants use Capsicum, or, as it is called in Europe, Cayan pepper, almost universally in its stead. Cloves and nutmegs, having been Uu 2 monopolized. r770. December, C , ^ - k"}, {"page_label": "Seite 340", "page_text": "340 LIEUTENANT COOK's VOYAGE 1770.

Cloves, although they are said originally to have been the produce of Machian, or Bachian, a small island far to the eastward, and only fifteen miles to the northward of the line, and to have been from thence disseminated by the Dutch, at their first coming into these parts, over all the eastern islands, are now confined to Amboina, and the small isles that lie in its neighbourhood; the Dutch having, by different treaties of peace between them and the conquered kings of all the other islands, stipulated, that they should have only a certain number of trees in their dominions, and in future quarrels, as a punishment for disobedience and rebellion, lessened the quantity, till at last they left them no claim to any. Nutmegs have in a manner been: extirpated in all the islands except their first native foil, Banda, which easily supplies every nation upon earth, and would as easily supply every nation in another globe of the fame dimensions, if there was any such to which the industrious Hollander could transport the commodity; it is, however, certain, that there are a few trees of this spice upon the coast of New Guinea. There may perhaps be both cloves and nutmegs upon other islands to the eastward; for those, neither the Dutch, nor any other European,, seem to think it worth while to examine. ■ The principal tame quadrupeds of this country are horses, cattle, bulfalos, sheep, goats, and hogs. The horses are small, never exceeding in size what we call a stout galloway, but they are nimble and spirited, and are reported to have been found here when the Europeans first came round the Cape of Good Hope.

I then repeated my request, that whatever the Council required of me might be given me in writing, that the sense of it might be fixed and certain, and that I might have time to consider of my reply; but he gave me to understand that he could not do this without an order from the Council, and I then absolutely refused to sign the paper, at the same time desiring an answer to my letter, which they not being prepared to give, we parted, not in very good humour with each other.

I replied, that I was not conscious of having in any instance acted contrary to the treaties subsisting between the two kingdoms, unworthy of my character as an officer, honoured with a commission of his Britannic Majesty, or unsuitable to the trust reposed in me, though I did not think I had been used by the Governor of Macasiar as the subject of a friend and ally; defiling that if they had any thing tcv allege against me, it might be reduced to writing, and laid before the King my Master, to whom alone I thought myself amenable.

I enquired whether there was not an answer to my letter in writing; to which he answered in the negative, adding, that it was not usual, a message by him, or some other officer, having been always thought sufficient. After this I was supplied, for my money, with every thing J could desire, from the Company's stores, without any further difficulty. A pilot was ordered to attend me, and on the 22 d, we an- Wedces 22. chored at Onrust, where, having cleared the ship, and put her stores on board the Company's vessel, we found the bowsprit and cap, as well as the main yard, rotten, and altogether unserviceable, the sheathing every where eaten off by the worms, and the main planks of the (hip's bottom so much damaged and decayed, that it was absolutely necessary to heave her down, before she could be sufficiently repaired to sail for Europe; but as other ships were already heaved down, and consequently the wharfs at this time prc-occu- pied, the carpenters could not begin their work till the 24th of July.

The flesti of those that we eat at Batavia, had a finer grain than European beef, but it was less juicy, and miserably lean. BufFalos are plenty, but the Dutcli never eat them, nor will they drink their milk, being prepossessed with a notion that both are unwholesome, and tend to produce fevers; though the natives and Chinese eat both, without any injury to their health. The sheep are of the kind which have long ears that hang down, and hair instead of wool: the fiesta of these is hard and tough, and in every respect the worst mutton we ever saw : we found here, however, a few Cape sheep, which are excellent, but so dear that we gave five and forty shillings a-piece for four of them, the heaviest of which weighed only five and forty pounds. The goats are not better than the sheep, but the hogs, especially the Chinese breed, are incomparable, and so fat, that the purchaser agrees for the lean separately. The butcher, who is always a Chinese, without the least scruple cuts off as much of the fat as he is desired, and afterwards fells it to his countrymen, who melt it down, and eat it instead of butter with their rice: but notwithstanding the excellence of this pork, the Dutch are so strongly prejudiced in favour of every thing that comes from their native country, that they eat only of the Dutch breed, which are here fold as much dearer than the Chinese, as the Chinese are sold dearer than the Dutch in Europe.

Among the mountains, and in the desart parts of the island, there are tygers, it is said, in great abundance, and some rhinoceroses ; in these parts also there are monkies, and there are a few of them even in the neighbourhood of Batavia.

It happens here, as in other places, that vanity gets the better even of appetite: the cheap fish, most of which is of the best kind, is the food only of staves, and that which is dear, only because it is scarce, and very much inferior in every respect, is placed upon the tables of the rich. A sensible housekeeper once spoke to us freely upon the subject. I know, said he, as well as you, that I could purchase a better dish of fish for a shilling, than what now costs me ten; but if I should make so good a use of my money, I should here be as much despised, as you would be in Europe, if y6u were to cover your table with offals, fit only for beggars or dogs. Turtle is also found here, but it is neither so sweet nor so fat as the West Indian turtle, even in London ; such as it is, however, we should consider it as a dainty; but the Dutch, among other singularities, do not eat it. We saw some lizards, or Iguanas, here of a very large size; we were told that some were as thick as a man's thigh, and Mr. Banks stiot one that was five feet long: the flesh of this animal proved to be very good food.

We some- times found the flesh of these animals lean and dry, but this \\--y--, was merely the effect of their being ill fed, for those that we fed ourselves were as good as any of the same kind that we had tasted in Europe, and we sometimes thought them even better. Wild fowl in general is scarce. We once saw a wild dude in the fields, but never any that were to be fold. We frequently saw snipes of two kinds, one of them exactly the same as that in Europe, and a kind of thrush was always to be had in great plenty of the Portuguese, who, for I know not what reason, seem to have monopolized the wild fowl and game. Of snipes, it is remarkable that they are found in more parts of the world than any other bird, being common almost all over Europe, Asia, Africa, and America. With respect to drink, Nature has not been quite so liberal to the inhabitants of Java as to some whom fire has placed in the less fruitful regions of the north. The native Javanese,, and most of the other Indians who inhabit this island, are indeed Mahometans, and therefore have no reason to regret the want of wine ; but, as if the prohibition of their law respected only the manner of becoming drank, and not drunkenness itself, they chew opium, to the total subversion 4 not only of their understanding but their health. The arrack that is made here, is too well known to need a description: besides which, the palm yields a wine of the- same kind with that which has already been described in the account of the island of Savu ; it is procured from the same tree, in the same manner, and is fold in three states.

In the other two states it has undergone a fermentation, and received an infusion of certain herbs and roots, by which it loses its sweetness, and acquires a taste very austere and disagreeable. In one of these states it is called Tuac eras, and in the other Tuac cutting , but the specific difference I do not know; in both, however, it intoxicates very powerfully. A liquor called Tuac is also made from the cocoa-nut tree, but this is used chiefly to put into the arrack, for in that which is good it is an estential ingredient.

T HE town of Batavia, although, as I have already oh- 177a. served, it is the capital of the Dutch dominions in India, i Dccembtf - i is so far from being peopled with Dutchmen, that not one fifth part, even of the European inhabitants of the town, and its environs, are natives of Holland, or of Dutch extraction: the greater part are Portuguese, and besides Europeans, there are Indians of various nations, and Chinese, besides a great number of negro slaves. In the troops, there are natives of almost every country in Europe, but the Germans are more than all the rest put together; there are some English and French, but the Dutch, though other Europeans are permitted to get money here, keep all the power in their own hands, and consequently possess all public employments. No man, of whatever nation, can come hither to settle, in any other character than that of a soldier in the Company's service, in which, before they are accepted, they must covenant to remain five years. As soon however as this form has been complied with, they are allowed, upon application to the council, to absent themselves from their corps, and enter immediately into any branch of trade, which their money or credit will enable them to carry on; and by this means it is that all the whitednhabitants of the place\"are soldiers.

These women imitate the Indians in every particular; their dress is made of the same materials, their hair is worn in the same manner, and they are equally enslaved by the habit of chewing betel. The merchants carry on their business here with less trouble perhaps than in any other part of the world: every manufacture is managed by the Chinese, who sell the produce of their labour to the merchant, resident here, for they are permitted to sell it to no one else; so that when a ship comes in, and bespeaks perhaps a hundred leagers of arrack, or any quantity of other commodities, the merchant has nothing to do but to fend orders to his Chinese to see them delivered on board: he obeys the command, brings a receipt signed by the master of the ship for the goods to his employer, who receives the money, and having deducted his profit, pays the Chinese his demand. With goods that are imported, however, the merchant has a little more trouble, for these he must examine, receive, and lay up in his warehouse, according to the practice of other countries. The Portuguese are called by the natives Oranserane, or Nazareen men, (Oran, being Man in the language of the country,) to distinguish them from other Europeans; yet they are included in the general appellation of Caper, or Cafir, an opprobrious term, applied by Mahometans to all who do not profess"}, {"page_label": "Seite 347", "page_text": "ROUND THE WORLD. 34 7 profess their faith. These people, however, are Portuguese 1770. only in name ; they have renounced the religion of Rome, and become Lutherans: neither have they the least communication with the country of their forefathers, or even know- lege of it: they speak indeed a corrupt dialect of the Portuguese language, but much more frequently use the Malay: they are never suffered to employ themselves in any but mean occupations: many of them live by hunting, many by washing linen, and some are handicraftsmen and artificers. They have adopted all the customs of the Indians, from whom they are distinguished chiefly by their features and complexion, their skin being considerably darker, and their noses more sharp ; their dress is exactly the same, except in the manner of wearing their hair. The Indians, who are mixed with the Dutch and Portuguese in the town of Batavia, and the country adjacent, are not, as might be supposed, Javanese, the original natives of the island, but natives of the various islands from which the Dutch import slaves, and are either such as have themselves been manumized, or the descendants of those who formerly received manumission; and they are all comprehended under the general name of Oranjlam , or Isalam> signifying Believers of the true Faith. The natives of every country, however, in other respects, keep themselves distinct from the rest, and are not less strongly marked than the staves by the vices or virtues of their respective nations. Many of these employ themselves in the cultivation of gardens, and in selling fruit and flowers. The betel and areca, which are here called Siri and Pinang , and chewed by both sexes and every rank in amazing quantities, are all grown by these Indians: lime is also mixed with these roots here as it is in Savu, but it is less pernicious to the teeth, because it is first flaked, and, besides the lime, a substance called gambir , X x 2 which"}, {"page_label": "Seite 348", "page_text": "34 8 LIEUTENANT COOK's VOYAGE 1770. which is brought from the continent of India; the better fork' December. v-\"-' or women also add cardamum, and many other aromatics, to give the breath an agreeable smell. Some of the Indians, however, are employed in fishing, and as lightermen, to carry goods from place to place by water; and some are rich, and live with much of the splendour of their country, which chiefly consists in the number of their slaves. In the article of food these Isalams are remarkably temperate : it consists chiefly of boiled rice, with a small proportion of buffalo, fish, or fowl, and sometimes of dried fish, and dried shrimps, which are brought hither from China; every dish, however, is highly seasoned with Cayan pepper, and they have many kinds of pastry made of rice flower, and other things to which I am a stranger; they eat also a great deal of fruit, particularly plantanes. But notwithstanding their general temperance, their feasts are plentiful, and, according to their manner, magnificent. As they are Mahometans, wine and strong liquors professedly make no part of their entertainment, neither do they often indulge with them privately,, contenting themselves with their betel and opium. The principal solemnity among them is a wedding, upon which occasion both the families borrow as many ornaments of gold and silver as they can, to adorn the bride and bridegroom, so that their dresses are very showy and magnificent. The feasts that are given upon these occasions among the rich, lasts sometimes a fortnight, and sometimes longer; and during this time, the man, although married on the first day, is, by the women, kept from his wife.

I returned thanks for the offer of refreshments, which however was a mere verbal civility, as it was known that I had lately failed from the places where M. Bougainville himself had been supplied; but 1 said that I had received letters for France from some Gentlemen of that country at the Cape, and if he would send liis boat on board they should be delivered to his messenger. Thus was an occasion furnished for what I have reason to believe was the principal object of M. Bougainville in speaking with us: a boat was immediately sent on board* and in her a young officer, drest in a waistcoat and trowsers ; whether he was thus dressed by design I shall not determine* but I soon perceived that his rank was much superior to his appearance. He came down to me in my cabbin, and after the usual compliments had passed, I asked him how he came to go home so soon in the season ; to which he replied, that there had been some disagreement between the Governor and inhabitants of the Iste of France, and that he had been sent home in haste with dispatches: this story was the more plausible, as I had heard of the dispute between the Governor and inhabitants of the Iste of France, from a French Gentleman, who came from thence, at the Cape of Good Hope i"}, {"page_label": "Seite 445", "page_text": "ROUND THE WORLD. . 445 Hope; yet I was not perfectly satisfied: for, supposing M.

To this, however, he readily replied, that they had made only a short trading voyage on the western coast of Sumatra. I then enquired, what commodities he had brought from thence ; and he answered, cocoa-nut oil, and rattans: but, said I, these are commodities which it is not usual to bring into Europe ; it is true, said he, but these commodities we left at the Iste of France, the oil for the use of the island, and the rattans for ships which were to touch there in their way to China, and 5 in exchange we took in another freight for Europe; this- freight I think he said was pepper, and his whole tale being at least possible, I a steed him no more questions.

Every little island indeed has a language of its own, and Java has two or three, but this lingua franca is the only language that is now spoken here, and, as I am told, it prevails over a great part of the East Indies. A dictionary of Malay and English was published in London by Thomas Bowrey, in the year 1701. Their women wear as much hair as can grow upon the head, and to increase the quantity, they use oils, and other preparations of various kinds. Of this ornament Nature has been very liberal; it is universally black, and is formed into a kind of circular wreath upon the top of the head, where it is fastened with a bodkin, in a taste which we thought inexpressibly elegant: the wreath of hair is surrounded by another of flowers, in which the Arabian jessamine is beautifully intermixed with the golden stars of the Banger Tanjong. Both sexes constantly bathe themselves in the river at least once a day, a practice which, in this hot country, is equally necessary both to personal delicacy and health. The teeth of these people also, whatever they may suffer in their colour by chewing beetle, are an object of great attention: the ends of them, both in the upper and under jaw, are rubbed with a kind of whetstone, by a very troublesome and painful operation, till they are perfectly even and flat, so that they cannot lose less than half a line in their length. A deep groove is then made cross the teeth of the upper jaw, parallel with the gums, and in the middle between them and the extremity of the teeth; the depth of this groove is at least equal to one-fourth of the thickness of the teeth, so that it penetrates far beyond what is called the enamel, the least injury to which, according to the dentists of Europe, is fatal; yet among these people, where the practice of thus wounding the enamel is universal, we never saw a rotten tOOth ; j 1770.

These are the people among whom the practice that is called a mock, or running a muck, has prevailed for time immemorial. It is well known, that to run a muck in the original sense of the word, is to get intoxicated with opium, and then rush into the street with a drawn weapon, and kill whoever comes in the way, till the party is himself either killed or taken prisoner; of this several instances happened while we were at Batavia, and one of the officers, whose business it is, among other things, to apprehend such people, told us, that there was scarcely a week in which he, or some of his brethren, were not called upon to take one of them into custody. In one of the instances that came to our know- lege, the party had been severely injured by the perfidy of women, and was mad with jealousy before he made himself drunk with opium ; and we were told, that the Indian who runs a muck is always first driven to desperation by some outrage, and always first revenges himself upon those who have done him wrong: we were also told, that though these unhappy wretches afterwards run into the street with a weapon in their hand, frantic and foaming at the mouth, yet they never kill any but those who attempt to apprehend them, or those whom they suspect of such an intention, and that whoever gives them way is safe. They are generally staves, who indeed are most subject to insults, and least able to obtain legal redress: freemen, however, are sometimes provoked into this extravagance, and one of the persons who run a muck while we were at Batavia, was free and in easy circumstances.

If the officer takes one of these amocks, or mohawks, as they have been called by an easy corruption, alive, his reward is very considerable, but if he kills them, nothing is added to his usual pay; yet such is the fury of their desperation, that three out of four are of neceffity destroyed in the attempt to secure them, though the officers are provided with instruments like large tongs, or pincers, to lay hold of them without coming within the reach of their weapon. Those who happen to be taken alive are generally wounded, but they are always broken alive upon the wheel, and if the physician who is appointed to examine their wounds, thinks them likely to be mortal, the punishment is inflicted immediately, and the place of execution is generally the spot where the first murder was committed. Among these people, there are many absurd practices and opinions which they derive from their Pagan ancestors: they believe that the devil, whom they call Satan, is the cause of all sickness and adversity, and for this reason, when they are sick, or in distress, they consecrate meat, money, and other things to him as a propitiation. If any one among them is restless, and dreams for two or three nights successively, he concludes that Satan has taken that method of laying his commands upon him, which if he neglects to fulfil, he will certainly suffer sickness or death, though they are not revealed with sufficient perspicuity to ascertain their meaning: to interpret his dream, therefore, he taxes his wits to the uttermost, and if, by taking it literally or figuratively, directly or by contraries, he can put no explanation upon • I 77 0> December."}, {"page_label": "Seite 352", "page_text": "LIEUTENANT COOK's VOYAGE 352 1770. upon it that perfectly satisfies him, he has recourse to the v_- v--' cawin or priest, who assists him with a comment and illustrations, and perfectly reveals the mysterious suggestions of the night. It generally appears that the devil wants victuals or money, which are always allotted him, and being placed -on a little plate of cocoa-nut leaves, are hung upon the branch of a tree near the river, so that it seems not to be the opinion of these people, that in prowling the earth the devil \" walketh through dry places.\" Mr. Banks once asked, whether they thought Satan spent the money, or eat the victuals ; he was answered, that as to the money it was considered rather as a mulct upon an offender, than a gift to him who had enjoined it, and that therefore if it was devoted by the dreamer, it mattered not into whose hands it came, and they supposed that it was generally the prize of some stranger who wandered that way; but as to the meat they were clearly of opinion that, although the devil did not cat the gross parts, yet, by bringing his mouth near it, he sucked out all its savour without changing its position, so that after-, wards it was as tasteless as water. But they have another superstitious opinion that is still, more unaccountable. They believe that women, when they. are delivered of children, are frequently at the same time ; delivered of a young crocodile, as a twin to the infant: they believe that these creatures are received most carefully by the midwife, and immediately carried down to the river, and put into the water. The family in which such a birth is supposed to have happened, constantly put victuals into the river for their amphibious relation, and especially the twin, who, as long as he lives, goes down to the river at stated seasons, to fulfil this fraternal duty, for the neglect of which it is the universal opinion that he will be visited with .sickness or death.

Nothing however can be more certain than the firm belief of this strange absurdity among them, for we had the concurrent testimony of every Indian who was questioned about it, in its favour. It seems to have taken its rife in the istands of Celebes and Boutou, where many of the inhabitants keep crocodiles in their families ; but however that be, the opinion has spread over all the eastern islands, even to Timor and > Ueram, and westward as far as Java and Sumatra, where, however, young crocodiles are, I believe, never kept. These crocodile twins are called Sudaras, and I shall relate one of the innumerable stories that were told us, in proof of their existence, from ocular demonstration. A young female slave, who was born and bred up among the Engliffi at Bencoolen, and had learnt a little of the language, told Mr. Banks that her father, when he was dying, acquainted her that he had a crocodile for his sudara , and solemnly charged her to give him meat when he should be dead, telling her in what part of the river he was to be found, and by what name he was to be called up. That in pursuance of her father's instructions and command, she went to the river, and standing upon the bank, called out Radja Pouti , white king, upon which a crocodile came to her out of the water, and eat from her hand the provisions that she had brought him. When she was desired to describe this paternal uncle, who in so strange a shape had taken up his dwelling in the water, she said, that he was not like Vol. III. Y y other 353 1770.

Mr. Banks heard this tale of ridiculous falsehood patiently to the end, and then dismissed the girl, without reminding her, that a crocodile with ears was as strange a monster as a dog with a cloven foot. Some time after this a servant whom Mr. Banks had hired at Batavia, and who was the son of a Dutchman by a Javanese woman, thought sit to acquaint his master that he had seen a crocodile of the same kind, which had also been seen by many others, both Dutchmen and Malays: that being very young, it was but two feet long, and had bracelets of gold upon its feet. There is no giving credit to these stories, said Mr. Banks, for I was told the other day that a crocodile had earrings ; and you know that could not be true, because crocodiles have no ears. Ah Sir, said the man, these Sudara Oran are not like other crocodiles ; they have five toes upon each foot, a large tongue that fills their mouth, and ears also, although they are indeed very small. How much of what these people related they believed, cannot be known; for there are no bounds to the credulity of ignorance and folly. In the girl's relation, however, there are some things in which she could not be deceived; and therefore must have been guilty of wilful falsehood. Her father might perhaps give her a charge to feed a crocodile, in consequence of his believing that it was his Sudara ; but its coming to her out of the river, when she called it by the name of White King, and taking the food she had brought it, must have been a fable of her own invention; for this being false, it was impossible that she should believe it to be true. The girl's story, however, as well as that of the man, is a strong proof that they both firmly believed the exist- 6 ence"}, {"page_label": "Seite 355", "page_text": "ROUND THE WORLD. 3 SS ence of crocodiles that are Sudaras to men; and the girl's December. fiction will be easily accounted for, if we recollect, that the ' --V--l earnest desire which every one feels to make others believe what he believes himself, is a strong temptation to support it by unjustifiable evidence. And the averring what is known to be false, in order to produce in others the belief of what is thought to be true, must, upon the most charitable principles, be imputed to many, otherwise venerable characters, through whose hands the doctrines of Christianity passed for many ages in their way to us, as the source of all the silly fables related of the Romish saints, many of them not less extravagant and absurd than this story of the White King, and all of them the invention of the first relates. The Bougis, Macassars, and Boetons, are so firmly persuaded that they have relations of the crocodile species in the rivers of their own country, that they perform a periodical ceremony in remembrance of them. Large parties of them go out in a boat, furnished with great plenty of provisions, and all kinds of music, and row backwards and forwards, in places where crocodiles and allegators are most common, singing and weeping by turns, each invoking his kindred, till a crocodile appears, when the music instantly stops, and provisions, betele, and tobacco are thrown into the water. By this civility to the species, they hope to recommend themselves to their relations at home ; and that it will be accepted instead of offerings immediately to themselves, which it is not in their power to pay. In the next rank to the Indians stand the Chinese, who in this place are numerous, but possess very little property; many of them live within the walls, and keep shops. The fruit-sellers of Passar Pissang have been mentioned already; but others have a rich show of European and Chinese goods: Y y 2 the"}, {"page_label": "Seite 454", "page_text": "CAPTAIN GARTERET's VOYAGE 4J4 ' - A.

Thus in many instances are the living sacrificed to the dead, and money that should discharge a debt, or feed an orphan, lavished in idle processions, or materials that are deposited in the earth to rot. Another numerous class among the inhabitants of this country is the staves; for by staves the Dutch, Portuguese, and Indians, however different in their rank or situation, are constantly attended : they are purchased from Sumatra, Malacca, and almost all the eastern islands. The natives of Java, very few of whom, as I have before observed, live in the neighbourhood of Batavia, have an exemption from sta- very under the sanction of very severe penal laws, which I believe are seldom violated. The price of these staves is from ten to twenty pounds sterling; but girls, if they have beauty, sometimes fetch a hundred. They are a very lazy set of people ; but as they will do but little work, they are content with a little victuals, subsisting altogether upon boiled rice, and a small quantity of the cheapest fish. As they are natives of different countries, they differ from each other extremely, both in person and disposition. The African negroes, called here Papua, are the worst, and consequently may be purchased for the least money: they are all thieves, and all incorrigible. Next to these are the Bougis and Macassars, both from the island of Celebes; these are lazy in the highest degree, and though not so much addicted to theft as the negroes, have a cruel and vindictive spirit, which renders them extremely dangerous; especially as, to gratify their resentment,"}, {"page_label": "Seite 359", "page_text": "ROUND THE WORLD. 3J9 resentment, they will make no scruple of sacrificing life. 177°* The best staves, and consequently the dearest, are procured 1 ( from the istand of Bali: the most beautiful women from Nias, a small island on the coast of Sumatra; but they are of a tender and delicate constitution, and soon fall a sacrifice to the unwholesome air of Batavia. Besides these, there are Malays, and staves of several other denominations, whose particular characteristics I do not remember. These staves are wholly in the power of their masters with respect to any punishment that does not take away life; but if a stave dies in consequence of punishment, though his death should not appear to have been intended, the master is called to a severe account, and he is generally condemned to suffer capitally. For this reason the master seldom inflicts punishment upon the slave himself, but applies to an officer called a Marineu, one of whom is stationed in every district. The duty of the Marineu is to quell riots, and take offenders into custody ; but more particularly to apprehend runaway slaves, and punish them for such crimes as the master, supported by proper evidence, lays to their charge: the punishment however is not inflicted by the Marineu in person, but. by slaves who are bred up to the business. Men are punished publicly, before the door of their master's house; but women within it. The punishment is by stripes, the number being proportioned to the offence; and they are given with rods made of rattans, which are split into slender twigs for the purpose, and fetch blood at every stroke. A common punishment costs the master a rix-dollar, and a severe one a du-- catoon, about six shillings and eight pence. The master is also obliged to allow the slave three dubbelcheys, equal to > about seven pence half-penny a week, as an encouragement, and to prevent his being under temptations to steal, too strong to be resisted.

As soon as we parted, the Indians dispersed, and we proceeded along the shore in search of a watering-place. In this we were more successful'; we found water very conveniently situated, and, if a little care was taken in filling it, we had reason to believe that it would prove good. Just as we were going off, some Indians, who remained.with a canoe upon the beach, fold us three turtle; but exacted a promise of us that we should not tell the King. The next morning, while a party was employed in filling water, we renewed our traffic for turtle: at first, the Indians dropped their demands slowly, but about noon, they agreed to take the price that we offered, so that before night we had turtle in plenty: the three that we had purchased the evening before, were in the mean time served to the ship's company, who, till the day before, had not once been served with salt provisions from the time of our arrival at Savu, which was now near four months. In the evening, Mr. Banks went to pay his respects to the King, at his palace, in the middle of a rice field, and though his Majesty was busily employed in dressing his own supper, he received the stranger very graciously. The next day, the natives came down to the trading-place, with fowls, fish, monkies, small deer, and some vegetables, but no turtle, for they said that we had bought them all the day before. The next day, however, more turtle appeared at market, and some were brought down every day afterwards, during our stay, though the whole, together, was not equal to the quantity that we bought the day after our arrival.

In about twa hours they arrived at a place where there were four or five houses, and meeting with an old man, they ventured to make some enquiries concerning the town. He said that it was far distant; but they were not to be discouraged in their enterprise, and he, seeing them proceed in their journey, joined company and went on with them. He attempted several times to lead them out of the way, but without success ; and at length they came within sight of the houses. The old man then entered cordially into their party, and conducted them into the town. The name of it is Samadang, it consists of about four hundred houses, and is divided by a river of brackish water into two parts, one of which is called the old town, and the other the new. As soon as they entered the old town, they met several Indians whom they had seen at the trading-place, and one of them undertook to carry them over to the new town, at the rate of two pence a head. When the bargain was made, two very small canoes were produced, in which they embarked; the canoes being placed along-side of each other, and held together, a precaution which was absolutely necessary to prevent their oversetting, the navigation was at length safely performed, though not without some difficulty; and when they landed in the new town, the people received them with great friendship, and showed them the houses of their Kings and principal people, which ^ are-"}, {"page_label": "Seite 368", "page_text": "3.68 LIEUTENANT COOK'S VOYAGE 1771- January.

Prince's Island is, upon the whole, certainly more eligible than either of them; and though the water is brackish, if it is filled at the lower part of the brook, yet higher up it will be found excellent. The first and second, and perhaps the third ship that comes in the season may be tolerably supplied with turtle ; but those that come afterwards must be content with small ones. Those that we bought were of the green kind, and at an average cost us about a half-penny or three farthings a pound. We were much disappointed to find them neither fat nor well flavoured and we imputed it to their having been long kept in crawls or pens of brackisli water, without food. The fowls are large, and we bought a dozen of them for a Spa- nisli dollar, which is about five pence a piece: the small deer cost us two pence a piece, and the larger, of which two only were brought down, a rupee. Many kinds of fish are to be had here, which the natives fell by hand, and we found them tolerably cheap. Cocoa-nuts we bought at the rate of a hundred for a dollar, if they were picked; and if they were taken promiscuously, one hundred and thirty. Plantains we found in great plenty; we procured also some pine apples, water melons, jaccas, and pumkins; besides rice, the greater part of which was of the mountain kind, that grows in dry land ; yams, and several other vegetables, at a very reasonable rate. The inhabitants are Javanese, whose Raja is subject to the Sultan of Bantam. Their customs are very similar to those of the Indians about Batavia; but they seem to be more jealous of their women, for we never saw any of them during all the time that we were there, except one by chance in the woods, as she was running away to hide herself.

Their food is nearly the same as that of the Batavian Indians, except the addition of the nuts of the palm, called Cycas circinalis , with which, upon the coast of New Holland, some of our people were made sick, and some of our hogs poisoned. Upon observing these nuts to be part of their food, we enquired by what means they deprived them of their deleterious quality; and they told us, that they first cut them into thin slices, and dried them in the fun, then steeped them in fresh water for three months, and afterwards, pressing out the water, dried them in the fun a second time; but we learnt that, after all they are eaten only in times of scarcity, when they mix them with their rice to make it go farther. The houses of their town are built upon piles, or pillars, four or five feet above the ground: upon these is laid a floor of bamboo canes, which are placed at some distance from each other, so as to leave a free paslage for the air from below : the walls also are of bamboo, which are interwoven, hurdlewise, with small sticks, that are fastened perpendicularly to the beams which form the frame of the building: it has a sloping roof, which is so well thatched with palm leaves, that neither the fun nor the rain can find entrance. The ground over which this building is erected, is an oblong square. In the middle of one fide is the door, and in the middle between that and the end of the house, towards the left hand, is a window: a partition runs out from each end towards the middle, which, if continued, would divide the whole floor into two equal parts, Iongitu- Vol. ILL 3 A dinally,"}, {"page_label": "Seite 370", "page_text": "LIEUTENANT COOK's VOYAGE 37 ° 1771.

There is no difference between the houses of the poor and the rich, but in the size ; except that the royal palace, and the house of a man, whose name is GunJang , the next in riches and influence to the King, is walled with boards instead of being wattled with sticks and bamboo. As the people are obliged to abandon the town, and live in the rice-fields at certain seasons, to secure their crops from the birds and the monkies, they have occasional houses there for their accommodation. They are exactly the same as the houses in the town, except that they are smaller, and are elevated eight or ten feet above the ground instead of four. The disposition of the people, as far as we could discover it, is good. They dealt with us very honestly, except, like all other Indians, and the itinerant retailers of fish in London, they asked sometimes twice, and sometimes thrice as much for their commodities as they would take. As what they brought to market, belonged, in different proportions, to a considerable number of the natives, and it would have been difficult to purchase it in separate lots, they found out a very easy expedient with which every one was satisfied: they put all that was bought of one kind, as plantains, or cocoa-nuts, together, and when we had agreed for the heap,, they divided, the. money that was pai d for it, among those 1. of"}, {"page_label": "Seite 371", "page_text": "ROUND THE WORLD. of whose separate property it consisted, in a proportion corresponding with their contributions. Sometimes, indeed, they changed our money, giving us 240 doits, amounting to five shillings, for a Spanish dollar, and ninety-six, amounting to two shillings, for a Bengal roupee. They all speak the Malay language, though they have a language of their own, different both from the Malay and the Javanese. Their own language they call Catta Gunung, the language of the mountains ; and they fay that it is spoken upon the mountains of Java, whence their tribe originally migrated, first to New Bay, and then to their present station, being driven from their first settlement by tygers, which they found too numerous to subdue. I have already observed, that several languages are spoken by the native Javanese, in different parts of their istand ; but when I fay that the language of these people is different from the Javanese, I mean that it is different from the language which is spoken at Samarang, a place that is distant only one day's journey from the residence of the emperor of Java.

That the names of numbers, in particular, are in a manner common to all these countries, will appear from the following comparative table, which Mr. Banks drew up, with the assistance of a negro slave, born at Madagascar, who was on board an English ship at Batavia, and sent to him to gratify his curiosity on this subject.

From the similitude between the language of the Eastern Indies, and the islands of the South Sea, conjectures may be formed with respect to the peopling those countries, which cannot easily be referred to Madagascar. The inhabitants of Java and Madagascar appear to be a different race; the Javanese is of an olive complexion, and has long hair ; the native of Madagascar is black, and his head is not covered with hair, but wool; and yet perhaps this will not conclude against their having common ancestors so strongly as at first appears. It does not seem less difficult to account for the personal difference between a native of England and France, as an effect of mere local situation, than for the difference between the natives of Java and Madagascar; yet it has never been supposed, that England and France were not peopled from common ancestors. If two natives of England marry in their own country, and afterwards remove to our settlements in the West Indies, the children that are conceived and born there will have the complexion and cast of countenance that distinguish the Creole ; if they return, the children conceived and born afterwards, will have no such characteristics. If it be said that the mother's mind being impressed with different external objects, impresses corresponding features and complexion upon the child during her pregnancy, it will be as difficult to refer the effect into this cause, upon mere physical principles, as into the other; for it can no more be shewn how a mere idea, conceived in the mother's imagination, can change the corporeal form of her infant, than how its form can be changed by mere local situation.

Our run from Java Head, to this place, afforded very few subjects of remark that can be of use to future navigators; such as occurred, however, I shall set down. We had left Java Head eleven days before we got the general south east trade-wind, during which time, we did not advance above 5 0 to the southward, and 3 0 to the west, having variable light airs, interrupted by calms, with sultry weather, and an unwholesome air, occasioned probably by the load of vapours which the eastern trade-wind, and westerly monsoons, bring into these latitudes, both which blow in these seas at the time of year when we happened to be there.

At first we suspected that this dreadful disorder might have been brought upon us by the water that we took on board at Prince's Island, or even by the turtle that we bought there ; but there is not the least reason to believe that this suspicion was well grounded, for all the ships that came from Batavia at the fame season, suffered in the same degree, and some of them even more severely, though none of them touched at Prince's Island in their way. A few days after we left Java, we saw boobies about the ship for several nights successively, and as these birds are known to roost every night on shore, we thought them an indication that some island was not far distant; perhaps it might be the island of Selam, which, in different charts, is very differently laid down both in name and situation. The variation of the compass off the west coast of Java is about 3 0 W. and so it continued without any sensible variation, in the common track of ships to the longitude of 288^ W. latitude 22 S. after which it increased apace, so that in longitude 295 0 , latitude 23 0 , the variation was io° 20 W.: in seven degrees more of longitude, and one of latitude, it increased"}, {"page_label": "Seite 379", "page_text": "ROUND THE WORLD. creased two degrees ; in the fame space, farther to the west, 1771. it increased five degrees : in latitude 28°, longitude 314 0 , it - was 24 0 , 20', in latitude 29 0 longitude 317 0 , it was 26° 10', Fnday IS and was then stationary for the space of about ten degrees farther to the west; but in latitude 34 0 , longitude 333 0 , we observed it twice to be 28°^ W. and this was its greatest variation, for in latitude 35°-!, longitude 337 0 , it was 24 0 , and continued gradually to decrease; so that off Cape Anguillas it was 22 0 30', and in Table Bay 20° 30' W. As to currents it did not appear that they were at all considerable, till we came within a little distance of the meridian of Madagascar; for after we had made 52 0 of longitude from Java Head, we found, by observation, that our error in longitude was only two degrees, and it was the fame when we had made only nineteen. This error might be owing partly to a current setting to the westward, partly to our not making proper allowances for the setting of the sea before which we run, and perhaps to an error in the assumed longitude of Java Head. If that longitude is erroneous, the error must be imputed to the imperfection of the charts of which I made use in reducing the longitude from Batavia, to that place; for there can be no doubt but that the longitude of Batavia is well determined. After we had passed the longitude of 307°, the effects of the westerly currents began to be considerable ; for in three days, our error in longitude was i° 5': the velocity of the current kept increasing, as we proceeded to the westward, in so much that for five days successively after we made the land, we were driven to the S.W. or S.W. by W. not less than twenty leagues a day; and this continued till we were within sixty or seventy leagues of the Cape, where the current set sometimes one way, and some^ times the other, though inclining rather to the westward. 3 h 3 After"}, {"page_label": "Seite 380", "page_text": "5 So 177*- March. >___ 1 Friday 15*.

LIEUTENANT COOK's VOYAGE After the boobies had left us, we saw no more birds till we got nearly abreast of Madagascar, where in latitude 27 °± 8. we saw an albatross, and after that time we saw them every day in great numbers, with birds of several other sorts, particularly one about as big as a ducfc, of a very dark brown colour, with a yellowish bill. These birds became more numerous as we approached the shore, and as soon as we got into> foundings we saw gannets, which we continued to fee as long as we were upon the bank which stretches off An- guillas to the distance of forty leagues, and extends along the shore to the eastward, from Cape False, according to some charts, one hundred and sixty leagues. The real extent of this bank is not exactly known ; it is however useful as a direction to shipping when to haul in, in order to make the land. While we lay here, the Hough ton Indiaman sailed for England, who, during her stay in India, lost by sickness between thirty and forty men; and when she left the Cape had many in a helpless condition with the scurvy. Other ships suffered in the same proportion, who had been little more than twelve months absent from England; our sufferings therefore were comparatively light, considering that we had been absent near three times as long. Having lain here to recover the sick, procure stores, and perform several necessary operations upon the ship and rigging, till the 1.3th of April, I then got all the sick on board, several of whom were still in a dangerous state, and having taken leave of the Governor, I unmoored the next morning, and got ready to fail'.

Notwithstanding all that has been said to the contrary, mo country that we saw during the voyage makes a more forlorn appearance, or is in reality a more sterile de fart. The land'over the Cape; which constitutes the peninsula formed by Table Bay on the north, and False Bay on the south, consists of high mountains, altogether naked and desolate: the land behind these to the east, which may be considered as the isthmus, is a plain of vast extent, consisting almost wholly of a light kind of sea sand, which produces nothing but heath, and is utterly incapable of cultivation. All the spots that will admit of improvement, which together bear about the fame proportion to the whole as one to one thousand, are laid out in vineyards, orchards, and kitchen grounds-;. and most of these, little spots lie at a considerable distance from each other. There is also the greatest reason to believe,, that in the interior parts of this country, that which is capable of cultivation does not bear a greater proportion-to - that which is incorrigibly barren; for the Dutch told us,., that ithey, had settlements eight and twenty days journey up > the country, a distance equal to at least nine hundred miles, from which they bring provisions to the Cape by land; so that it seems, reasonable to conclude that provisions are not ■ to be had within a less compass.

That the country is every where destitute of wood appears to demonstration; for timber and planks are imported from Batavia, and fuel is almost as dear as food. We saw no tree, except in plantations near the town, that was fix feet high ; and the stems, that were not thicker than a man's thumb, had roots as thick as an arm or a leg, such is the influence of the winds here to the disadvantage of vegetation, setting the sterility of the soil out of the question. The only town which the Dutch have built here is, from its situation, called Cape Town, and consists of about a thousand houses, neatly built of brick, and in general whited on the outside; they are however covered only with thatch, for the violence of the south east winds would render any other roof inconvenient and dangerous. The streets are broad and commodious, all crossing each other at right angles. In the principal street there is a canal, on each fide of which is planted a row of oaks, that have flourished tolerably well, and yield an agreeable shade: there is a canal also in one other part of the town, but the slope of the ground in the course of both is so great, that they are furnislied with floodgates, or locks, at intervals of little more than fifty yards. A much greater proportion of the inhabitants are Dutch in this place than in Batavia; and as the town is supported principally by entertaining strangers, and supplying them with necessaries, every man, to a certain degree, imitates the manners and customs of the nation with which he is chiefly concerned. The ladies however are so faithful to the mode of their country, that not one of them will stir without a chaudpied or chauffet, which is carried by a servant that it may be ready to place under her feet whenever she shall sit down.

The women in general are very handsome; they have fine clear skins, and a bloom of colour that indicates a purity of constitution, and high health.

The air is salutary in a high degree; so that those who bring diseases hither from Europe, generally recover perfect; health in a short time j but the diseases that are brought from India are not so certainly cured. Notwithstanding the natural sterility of the climate, industry has supplied this place with all the necessaries, and even the luxuries of life in the greatest profusion. The beef and mutton are excellent, though the cattle and sheep are natives of the country; the cattle are lighter than ours, more neatly made, and have horns that spread to a much wider extent. The sheep are clothed with a substance between wool and hair, and have tails of an enormous size ; we saw some that weighed twelve pounds, and were told that there were many much larger. Good butter is made of the milk of the cows, but the cheese is very much inferior to our own. Here are goats, but they are never eaten, hogs, and a variety of poultry. Hares are also found here, exactly like those of Europe; antelopes of many kinds, quails of two forts, and bustards, which are well flavoured, but not juicy. The fields produce European wheat and barley, and the gardens European vegetables, and fruit of all kinds, besides plantains, guavas, jambu, and some other Indian fruits, but these are not in perfection ; the plantains in particular, are very bad, and the guavas no larger than gooseberries.

There is another vineyard near it, where wine is made that is called by the fame name, but it is greatly inferior. The common method in which strangers live here, is to lodge and board with some of the inhabitants, many of whose houses are always open for their reception: the rates are from five shillings to two shillings a day, for which all necessaries are found. Coaches may be hired at four and twenty shillings a day, and horses at six shillings ; but the -country affords very little temptation to use them. There are no public entertainments; and those that are private, to which strangers of the rank of Gentlemen are always admitted, were suspended while we were there by the breaking out of the measles.

The greater part of this garden is kitchen ground ; but two small squares are allotted to botanical plants, which did not appear to be so numerous by one half as they were when Oldenland wrote his catalogue.

These are in general of a slim make, and rather lean than plump, but remarkably strong, nimble, and active. Their size is nearly the same with that of Europeans, and we saw some that were six feet high; their eyes are dull and without expression: their sldns are of the colour of foot, but that is in a great measure caused by the dirt, which is so wrought into the grain that it cannot be distinguished from complexion 5 for I believe they never wash any part of their bodies.

Their clothing consists of a skin, generally that of a flieep, thrown over their shoulders; besides which, the men wear a small pouch in the middle of the waist, and the women, a broad leather slap, both which hang from a girdle or belt that is adorned with beads and small pieces of copper. Both men and women wear necklaces, and sometimes bracelets, of beads; and the women wear rings of hard leather round their ancles, to defend them from the thorns, with which their country every where abounds : some of them have a sandal, made of wood or bark; but the greater part of them are unshod.

Most of these Hottentots speak Dutch, without any peculiarity of pronunciation. They are all modest, even to sheepishness; for it was not without the greatest difficulty that we could persuade any of them to dance, or even to speak in their own language to each other, in our presence. We did however both see them dance, and hear them sing; their dances are by turns active and stuggiffi to excess; sometimes consisting of quick and violent motions, with strange distortions of the body, and unnatural leaps backwards and forwards, with the legs crossing each other; and being sometimes so spiritless that the dancer only strikes the ground first with one foot and then with the other, neither changing place nor moving any other part of his body: the songs also are alternately to quick and stow movements, in the same extremes as the dance. We made many enquiries concerning these people of the Dutch, and the following particulars are related upon the credit of their report: Within the boundaries of the Dutch settlements there are several nations of these people, who very much differ from each other in their customs and manner of life: all however are friendly and peaceable, except one clan that is settled to the eastward, which the Dutch call Bosch men y and these live entirely by plunder, or rather by theft; for they never attack their neighbours openly, but steal the cattle privately in the night.

As a defence against these freebooters, the other Indians train up bulls, which they place round their towns in the night, and which, upon the approach of either man or beast, will assemble and oppose them, till they hear the voice of their masters encouraging them to fight, or calling them off, which they obey with the same docility as a dog. Some nations have the art of melting and preparing copper, which is found among them, probably native f and of this they make broad plates, which they wear as ornaments upon their foreheads. Some of them also know how to harden bits of iron, which they procure from the Dutch, and form into knives, so as to give them a temper superior to that of any they can buy.

We were very desirous to determine the great question among natural historians, whether the women of this country have or have not that fleshy flap or apron which has been called the Sinus pudoris , and what we learnt I shall relate. Many of the Dutch and Malays, who said they had received' favours from Hottentots women, positively denied its existence; but a physician of the place declared that he had: cured many hundreds of venereal complaints, and never saw one without two fleshy, or rather skinny appendages, proceeding from the upper part of the Labia-y in appearance somewhat resembling the teats of a cow, but flat; they hung down, he said, before the Pudendum , and were in different subjects of different lengths, in some not more than half an inch, in others three or four inches: these he imagined to be what some writers have exaggerated into a flap, or apron, hanging down from the bottom of the abdomen, of sufficient extent to render an artificial covering of the neighbouring parts unnecessary.

The bottom of it is slightly covered with herbage, but the sides are as naked as the cliffs that are next the sea. Such is the first appearance of the island in its present cultivated state, and the first hills must be passed before the vallies look green, or the country displays any other marks of fertility.

The white inhabitants are all English, who, as they are not permitted by the East India Company, to whom the island belongs, to carry on any trade or commerce on their own account, subsist wholly by supplying such ships as touch at the place with refreshments, which, however, they do not provide in proportion to the fertility of the foil, and the temperament of the climate, which would enable them, by cultivation, to produce all the fruits and vegetables both of Europe and India.

Among the native products of this island, which are not numerous, must be reckoned ebony, though the trees are now nearly, extinct, and are not remembered to have been plenty: pieces of the wood are frequently found in the vallies, of a fine black colour, and a hardness almost equal to iron: these pieces, however, are always so short and crooked, that no use can be made of them.

We continued to sail in company with the steer, till the Friday io, lOlh in the morning, when, perceiving that we sailed much heavier than any other ship, and thinking it for that reason probable that the Portland would get home before us, I made the signal to speak with her, upon which Captain Elliot himself came on board, and I delivered to him a letter for the Admiralty, with a box, containing the common log-books of the ship, and the journals of some of the officers.

When we left these people, we went to the other end of the island, and there taking water, crossed over to the main, where we saw several houses, but no inhabitants, except a few in some straggling canoes, that seemed to be fishing. After viewing this place, we returned on board the ship to dinner. During our visit to the Indians this day, Tupia being always of our party, they had been observed to be continually talking of guns, and shooting people: for this subject of their conversation we could not at all account; and it had so much engaged our attention, that we talked of it ass the way back, and even after we got on board the ship: we had perplexed ourselves with various conjectures, which were all given up in their turn; but now we learnt, that on the 21st one of our officers, upon pretence of going out to fish, had rowed up to the Hippah, and that two or three canoes coming oss towards his boat, his fears suggested that au attack was intended, in consequence of which three muskets were fired, one with small shot, and two with ball, at the Indians, who retired with the utmost precipitation, having probably come out with friendly intentions, for such their behaviour both before and afterwards expressed, and having no reason to expect such treatment from people who had always behaved to them not only with humanity, but kindness, and to whom they were not conscious of having given, offence. 1 On 1 4 '"}, {"page_label": "Seite 397", "page_text": "ROUND THE WORLD. 397 On the 25th, I made another excursion along the coast, in 1770. the pinnace, towards the mouth of the inlet, accompanied by ■ Januar> \\ . Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, and going on shore at a little Thursda > rz s cove, to shoot shaggs, we fell in with a large family of Indians, whose custom it is to disperse themselves among the different creeks and coves, where fish is to be procured in the greatest plenty, leaving a few only in the Hippah, to which the rest repair in times of danger. Some of these people came out a good way to meet us, and gave us an invitation to go with them to the rest of their party, which we readily accepted. We found a company of about thirty, men, women, and children, who received us with all possible demonstrations of friendship: we distributed among them a few ribands and beads,'and in return, received the kisses and embraces of both sexes, both young and old: they gave us also some fish, and after a little time we returned, much pleased with our new acquaintance. In the morning of the 26th, I went again out in the boat, Friday *6. with Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, and entered one of the bays, which lie on the east side of the inlet, in order to get another sight of the streight, which pasted between the eastern and western seas. For this purpose, having landed at a convenient place, we climbed a hill of very considerable height, from which we had a full view of it, with the land on the opposite shore, which we judged to be about four leagues distant; but as it was hazey in the horizon, we could not fee far to the south east: I resolved however to search the passage with the ship, as soon as I should put to sea. Upon the top of this hill we found a parcel of loose stones, with which we erected a pyramid, and left in it some musket balls, small shot, beads, And other things, which we happened to have about us, that were likely to stand the test of time, and not being of Indian workmanship, would con- 3E 2 vince"}, {"page_label": "Seite 398", "page_text": "39 8 LIEUTENANT COOK'S VOYAGE *77°* vince any European who should come to the place and pull it down, that other natives of Europe had been there before Fnday z6. ^im. When this was done, we descended the hill, and made a comfortable meal of the shaggs and fish which our guns and lines had procured us, and which were dressed by the boat's crew in a place that we had appointed: in this place we found another Indian family, who received us, as usual, with strong expressions of kindness and pleasure, shewing us where to procure water, and doing us such other good offices as were in their power. From this place we went to the town, of which the Indians had told us, who visited us on the 19th: this, like that which we had seen before, was built upon a small istand or rock, so difficult of access, that we gratified our curiosity at the risk of our necks. The Indians here also received us with open arms, carried us to every part of the place, and shewed us all that it contained : this town, like the other, consisted of between eighty and an hundred houses, and had only one fighting-stage. We happened to have with us a few nails and ribands, and some paper, with which our guests were so gratified, that at our coming away they filled our boat with dried fish, of which we perceived they had laid up great quantities. Saturday 27. The 27th and 28th were spent in resitting the ship for the sea, fixing a transom for the tiller, getting stones on board to put into the bottom of the bread-room, to bring the ship more by the stern, in repairing the calks, and catching fish. Monday 29. On the 2yth, we received a visit from our old man, whose name we found to be Topaa, and three other natives, with whom Tupia had much conversation.

This day also I went on shore again myself, upon the western point of the inlet, and from a hill of considerable height, I had a view of the coast to the N. W. The farthest land I could see in that quarter, was an island which has been mentioned before, at the distance of about ten leagues, lying not far from the main: between this island and the place where I stood, I discovered, close under the ssiore, several other islands, forming many bays, in which there appeared to be good anchorage for shipping. After I had set off the different points for my survey, I erected another pile of stones, in which 1 left a piece of silver coin, with some musketjialls and beads, and a piece of an old pendant flying on the top. In my return to the ship, I made a visit to several of the natives, whom I saw along the shore, and purchased a small quantity of fish. On the zvth, early in the morning, I sent a boat to one of Tuesday 30, the islands for celery, and while the people were gathering it, about twenty of the natives, men, women, and children, landed near some empty huts: as soon as they were on shore, five or six of the women sat down upon the ground together, and began to cut their legs, arms, and faces, with shells, and sharp pieces of talc or jasper, in a terrible manner.

The carpenter having prepared two posts to be left as memorials of our having visited this place, I ordered them to be inscribed with the ship's name, and the year and month; one of them I set up at the watering-place, hoisting the Union flag upon the top of it; and the other I carried over to the island that lies nearest to the sea, called by the natives Mo- tuara. I went first to the village or Hippah, accompanied by Mr. Monkhouse and Tupia, where I met with our old man, and told him and several others, by means of Tupia, that we were come to set up a mark upon the island, in order to show to any other ship which should happen to come thither, that we had been there before. To this they readily consented, and promised that they never would pull it down: I then gave something to every one present; and to the old man I gave a silver threepence, dated 1736, and some spike nails, with the king's broad arrow cut deep upon them; things which I thought most likely to remain long among them: I then took the post to the highest part of the island, and after fixing it firmly in the ground, I hoisted upon it the Union-slag, and honoured this inlet with the name of Queen Charlotte's Sound, at the same time taking formal posse slion of this and the adjacent country, in the name and for the use of his Majesty King George the Third. We then drank a bottle of wine to her Majesty's health, and gave the bottle to the old man who had attended us up the hill, and who was mightily delighted with his present. While the post was setting up, we enquired of the old man concerning the paslage into the eastern sea, the existence of which he confirmed; and then asked him about the land to the S. W. of the streight, where we were then situated: this land, he said, consisted of two Whennuas or islands, which might be circumnavigated in a few days, and which he called Tovy Poenam.moo ; the literal translation of this word is,"}, {"page_label": "Seite 401", "page_text": "ROUND THE WORLD. 4.01 is, \" the water of green talcand probably if we had under- 1770- stood him better, we should have found that Tovy Poenammoo was the name of some particular place where they got the Tuesda ys°* green talc or stone of which they make their ornaments and tools, and not a general name for the whole southern district:: he said, there was also a third Whennua, on the east side of the streight, the circumnavigation of which would take up many moons: this he called Eaheinomauwf, ; and to the land on the borders of the streight he gave the name of Tiera Witte.. Having set up our post, and procured this intelligence, we returned on board the strip, and brought the old man with us, who was attended by his canoe, in which, after dinner, he returned home.

The people here confirmed all that the old man had told us concerning the streight and the. country, and about noon I took leave of them: some of them seemed to be sorry, and others glad, that we were going: the fish which I had bought they sold freely, but there were some who strewed manifest signs of disapprobation. As we returned to the strip, some of us made an excursion along the shore to the northward, to traffic with the natives for a farther supply of fish; in which, however, they had no great success. In the evening, we got every thing off from the shore, as I intended to fail in the morning, but the wind would not permit. , On the 4th, while we were waiting for a wind, we amused ourselves by fishing, and gathering shells and feeds of various kinds ; and early in the morning of the 5th, we cast off the hawser, hove short on the bower, and carried the kedge anchor out in order to warp the ship out of the cove, which having done about two o'clock in the afternoon, we hove up the anchor and got under sail; but the wind soon failing, we were obliged to come to an anchor again a little above Motuara. When we were under sail, our old man Topaa came on board to take his leave of us, and as we were still desirous of making farther enquiries whether any memory of Tasman had been preserved among these people, Tupia was directed to ask him whether he had ever heard that such a vessel as ours had before visited the country. To this he replied in the negative, but said, that his ancestors had told him there had once come to this place a small vessel, from a distant country, called Ulimaroa, in which were four men, who, upon their coming on shore, were all killed: upon being asked where this distant land Tay, he pointed to the northward. Of Ulimaroa we had heard something before, from the people about the Bay of Islands, who 8 said"}, {"page_label": "Seite 403", "page_text": "ROUND THE WORLD. 42Z ■said that their ancestors had visited it; and Tupia had also talked to us of Ulimaroa, concerning which he had some confused traditionary notions, not very different from those of our old man, so that we could draw no certain conclusion from the accounts of either. Soon after the strip came to an anchor the second time, Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander went on shore, to see if any gleanings of natural knowlege remained, and by accident fell in with the most agreeable Indian family they had seen, which afforded them a better opportunity of remarking the personal subordination among these people, than had before offered. The principal persons were a widow, and a pretty boy about ten years old: the widow was mourning for her husband with tears of blood, according to their custom, and the child, by the death of its father, was become proprietor of the land where we had cut our wood. The mother and the son were sitting upon matts, and the rest of the family, to the number of sixteen or seventeen, of both sexes, fat round them in the open air, for they did not appear to have any house, or other slielter from the weather, the inclemencies of which, custom has probably enabled them to endure without any lasting inconvenience. Their whole behaviour was affable, obliging, and unsuspicious; they presented each person with fish, and a brand of fire to dress it, and pressed them many times to stay till the morning, which they would certainly have doneif they had not expected the ship to fail, greatly regretting that they had not become acquainted with them sooner, as they made no doubt but that more knowlege of the manners and disposition of the inhabitants of this country would have been obtained from them in a day, than they had yet been able to acquire during our whole stay upon the coast.

The entrance of Queen Charlotte's Sound is situated in latitude 41 0 8. longitude 184° 45' W. and near the middle of the south west side of the streight in which it lies. The land of the south east head of the Sound, called by the natives Koam aroo, off which lie two small islands and some rocks, makes the narrowest part of the streight. From the north west head a reef of rocks runs out about two miles, in the direction of N. E. by N.; part of which is above the water, and part below. By this account of the heads, the Sound will be sufficiently known: at the entrance, it is three leagues broad, and lies in S. W. by S. S. W. and W. S. W. at least ten leagues, and is a collection of some of the finest harbours in the world, as will appear from the plan, which is laid down with all the accuracy that time and circumstances would admit. The land forming the harbour or cove in which we lay, is called by the natives Totarranue: the harbour itself, which I called Ship Cove, is not inferior to any in the Sound, either for convenience or safety: it lies on the west side of the Sound, and is the southermost of three coves, that are situated within the island of Motuara, which bears east of it. Ship Cove may be entered, either between Motuara and a long island, called by the natives Hamote, or between Motuara and the western shore. In the last of these channels are two ledges of rocks, three fathom under water, which may easily be known by the sea-weed that grows upon them, in sailing either in or out of the Sound, with little wind, attention"}, {"page_label": "Seite 405", "page_text": "ROUND THE WORLD. 405 tendon must be had to the tides, which flow about nine or 1770. ten o'clock at the full and change of the moon, and rife and i Fe - u - ary * / fall between seven and eight feet perpendicularly.

The sea abounds with a variety of fish, so that without going out of the cove where we lay, we caught every day, with the seine and hooks and lines, a quantity sufficient to serve the whole ship's company: and along the shore we found plenty of shags, and a few other species of wild-fowl, which those who have long lived upon salt provisions will not think despicable food. The number of inhabitants scarcely exceeds four hundred, and they live dispersed along the shores, where their food, consisting of silh and fern roots, is most easily procured; for we saw no cultivated ground. Upon any appearance of danger, they retire to their Hip pahs, or forts; in this situation we found them, and in this situation they continued for some time after our arrival. In comparison of the inhabitants of other parts of this country, they are poor, and their canoes are without ornament; the little traffic we had with them was wholly for fish, and indeed they had scarcely any thing else to dispose of.

They were at first very fond of paper; but when they found that it was spoiled by being Wet, they would not take it: neither did they set much value upon the cloth of Otaheite; but English broad cloth, and red kersey, were in high estimation ; which sliewed that they had sense enough to appretiate the commodities which we offered by their use, which is more than could be said of some of their neighbours, who made a much better appearance. Their dress has been mentioned already, particularly their large round head-dresses of feathers, which were far from being unbecoming. ! As soon as we got out of the Sound, I stood over to the eastward, in order to get the streight well open before the tide of ebb came on. At seven in the evening, the two small islands which lie off Cape Koamaroo, the south east head of Queen Charlotte's Sound, bore east, distant about four miles: at this time it was nearly calm, and the tide of ebb setting out, we were, in a very short time, carried by the rapidity of the stream close upon one of the islands, which was a rock rising almost perpendicularly out of the sea: we perceived our danger increase every moment, and had but one expedient to prevent our being dashed to pieces, the success of which a few minutes would determine. We were now within little more than a cable's length of the rock, and had more than feventy-five fathom water j but upon dropping an anchor, and veering about one hundred and fifty fathom of cable, the ship was happily brought up: this, however, would not have saved us, if the tide which set S. by E. had not, upon meeting with the island, changed its direction to S.

Over this land appeared a mountain of stupendous height, which was covered with snow. The narrowest part of the streight, through which we had been driven with such rapidity, lies between Cape Tiera- witte, on the coast of Eaheinomauwe, and Cape Koamaroo: the distance between them I judged to be between four or five leagues, and notwithstanding the tide, now its strength is known, may be passed without much danger. It is however safest to keep on the north east shore, for on that side there appeared to be nothing to fear; but on the other shore there are not only the islands and rocks which lie oss Cape Koamaroo r but a reef of rocks stretching from these islands six or seven miles to the southward, at the distance of two or three miles from the shore, which I had discovered from the hill when I took my second view of the streight from the east to the western sea. The length of the streight we had passed I shall not pretend to assign, but some judgment may be formed of it from a view of the chart.

To this point I have given the name of Cape Palliser, in honour of my worthy friend Captain Palliscr. It lies in latitude 41 0 34' S. longitude 183 0 58\" W. and bore from us this day at noon 8.79 E. distant about thirteen leagues, the ship being then in the latitude of 41 0 27' 8.; Koamaroo at the fame time bearing N. -i E. distant seven or eight leagues.

They came on board with very little invitation; and their behaviour was courteous and friendly: upon receiving presents from us, they made us presents in return, which had not been done by any of the natives that we had seen before.

The term Whoiv, indeed, conveyed to them the idea not of their quality, but only of their use; for it is the fame by which they distinguish a tool, commonly made of bone, which they use both asi.an augur and a chiffel. However, their knowing that we had Whoiv to fell, was a proof that their connections extended as far north as Cape Kidnappers, which was distant no less than forty-five leagues ; for that was the southermost place on this fide the coast where we had had any traffic with the natives. It is also probable, that the little knowlege which the inhabitants of Queen Charlotte's Sound had of iron, they obtained from 'their neighbours at Tierawitte; for we had no reason to think that the inhabitants of any part of this coast had the least knowlege of iron or its use before we came among them, especially as when it was first offered they seemed to disregard it as of no value. We thought it probable, that we were now once more in the territories of Teratu; but upon enquiring of these people, they said that he was not their King.

In the mean time, our people observed a great hurry and bustle on shore,.and all the sloops and vessels that were proper for war were fitted out with the utmost expedition: we should, however, I believe, have been an overmatch for their whole sea force, if all our people had been well. In the mean time I intended to have gone and anchored close to the town, but now the boat was absent, our united strength was not sufficient to weigh the anchor, though a small one. After waiting five hours in the boat, the Lieutenant was told that the Governor had ordered two gentlemen to wait upon me with an answer to my letter. Soon after he had returned, and made this report, the two gentlemen came on board, and we afterwards learnt that one of them was an ensign of the garrison, named Le Cerf, and the other Mr. Douglas, a writer of the Dutch East India Company : they delivered me the Governor's letter, but it proved to be written in Dutch, a language which not a single person on board could understand: the two gentlemen who brought it, however, both spoke French, and one of them interpreted the contents to me in that language. The purport of it was, \" that I should instantly depart from the port, without coming any nearer to the town; that I should not anchor on any part of the coast, or permit any of my people to land in any place that was under his jurisdiction.\" Before I made any reply to this letter, I strewed the gentlemen who brought it the number of my sickat the sight of so many unhappy wretches, who were dying of lan- 3 G 2 guor 1-767.

At this they seemed to be alarmed, as our situation alone was sufficient to convince them that I was in earnest, and urged me with great emotion to remain where I was, at least till I had heard again from the Governor: to this, after some altercation, I consented, upon condition that I heard from the Governor before the sea-breeze set in the next day. We passed all the remainder of this day, and all the night, in a state of anxiety, not unmixed with indignation, that greatly aggravated our distress ; and very early the next Thursday 17. morning, we had the mortification to see a stoop that mounted"}, {"page_label": "Seite 413", "page_text": "ROUND THE WORLD. mounted eight carriage guns, and one of the vessels of the country, fitted out for war, with a great number of soldiers on board, come from the town, and anchor under each of our bows. I immediately sent my boat to speak with them, but they would make no reply to any thing that was said. About noon, the sea-breeze set in, and not having then heard again from the Governor, I got under sail, and proceeded towards the town, according to my declaration, resolving, if the vessels that had anchored under our bows, should oppose us, to repress force with force as far as we were able: these two vessels, however, happily both for us and for them, contented themselves with weighing anchor, and attending our motions. Very soon after we had got under sail, a handsome vessel, with a band of mufick, and several gentlemen on boards made up to us, and told us that they were sent by the Governor, but could not come aboard if we did not drop our anchor again; our anchor therefore was immediately dropped, and the gentlemen came on board: they proved to be Mr. Blydenbourg, the fiscal, Mr. Voll, the fliebander, an officer called the licence-master, or master of the port, and Mr. Douglas the writer, who has been mentioned already. They expressed some surprize at my having got under sail, and asked me what 1 intended to have done; I told them that I intended, neither more nor less than to fulfil the declarations I had made the day before ; that justified by the common rights of mankind, which were superior to every other law, I would, rather than have put again to sea, where our destruction either by shipwreck, sickness, or famine, was inevitable, have come up to their walls, and either have compelled them to furnish the necessaries we wanted, or have run the ship on shore, since it was better to perish at once in a just contest, than to suffer the lingering misery of 4 anticipating 1767.

I observed also, that no civilized people had ever fullered even the captives of war to perish for want of the necessaries of life, mitch less the subjects of an ally, who asked nothing but permission to purchase food with their money. They readily allowed the truth of all I had said, but seemed to think I had been too hasty: I then observed that I had waited the full time of my stipulation, and they in return made some excuse for their not having come sooner, telling me that, as a proof of their having admitted my claim, they had brought me such provisions as their country would afford. These were immediately taken on board, and consisted of two sheep, an elk ready killed, and a few fowls, with some vegetables and fruit. This most welcome supply was divided among the people, and that most salutary, and to us exquisite dainty, broth, made for the sick. Another letter from the Governor was then produced, in which, to my great disappointment, I was again ordered to leave the port, and to justify the order, it was alleged, that to suffer a ship of any nation to stay and trade either at this port, or any other part of the island, was contrary to the agreement which had been made by the East India Company with the native Kings and Governors of the country, who had already expressed some displeasure on our account; and for farther particulars I was referred to the gentlemen that brought the letter, w hom the Governor filled his commissaries. To these gentlemen I immediately observed, that no stipulation concerning trade could affect us, as we were a King's ship; at the fame time I produced my commission, it not being possible to bring under the article of trade the selling us food * nd refreshments for our money, without the utmost violence to language and common sense.

This put them to a stand, but after a short pause, they enquired very particularly whether I had been among the spice islands ; I answered them in the negative, and they appeared to be convinced that I spoke truth. After this we came to a better understanding, and they told me, that though they could not, without disobedience to the most direct: and positive orders of the Company, suffer us to remain here, yet that I was welcome to go to a little bay not far distant, where I should find effectual shelter from the bad monsoon, and might erect an hospital for my sick, assuring me at the same time that provision and refreshments were more plenty there than at Macassar, from whence, whatever else I wanted should be sent me, and offering me a good pilot to carry me to my station. To this I gladly consented, upon condition that what they had offered should be confirmed to me by the Governor and Council of Macassar, that I might be considered as under the protection of the Dutch nation, and that no violence should be offered to my people: for all this they engaged their honour on behalf of the Governor and Council,- promising me the assurance I had required on the next day, and requesting that in the mean time I would remain where I was. I then enquired why the two vessels which were at anchor under our bows were allotted to that station, and they told me, for no other reason than to prevent the people of the country from offering us any violence.

It is with the greatest pleasure that I take this opportunity of acknowledging my obligations to these Gentlemen for the politeness and humanity of their behaviour in their private capacity, and particularly to Mr. Douglas, who being qualified by his knowlege of the French language to interpret between us, undertook that office with a courtesy and politeness which very much increased the value of the favour.

Every thing was now settled much to my satisfaction, except the procuring money for my bills upon the government of Great Britain, which the Shebander said he would solicit. At eight o'clock in the evening, he came on board again, to let me know that there was not any person in the town who had money to remit to Europe, and that there was not a dollar in the Company's chest. I answered, that as I was not permitted to go on shore to negociate my bills myself, I hoped they would give me credit, offering him bills for any debt I should contract, or to pay it at Batavia. To this the Shebander replied, that the Resident at Bonthain, the place to which I was going, would receive orders to supply me with whatever I should want, and would be glad to take my bills in return, as he had money to remit, and was himself to go to Europe the next season.

I immediately waited upon the Resident, Mr. Swellingrabel, who spoke English but very imperfectly, and having settled with him all matters relating to money and provisions, a house was allotted me near the sea-side, and close to a little pallisadoed fort of eight guns, the only one in this place, which I converted into an hospital, under the direction of the Surgeon ; to this place I immediately sent all the people who were thought incapable of recovering on board, and reserved the rest as a security against accidents.

When they saw any of the country people carrying what they thought our invalids would purchase, they first took it away, and then asked the price: what was demanded signified little, the soldier gave what he thought proper, which was seldom one fourth of the value ; and if the countryman ventured to express any discontent, he gave him immediately an earnest of perfect satisfaction, by flourishing his broad-sword over his head; this was always sufficient to silence complaint, and send the sufferer quietly away ; after which the soldier sold what he had thus acquired for profit of sometimes more than a thousand per Cent. This behaviour was so cruel to the natives, and so injurious to us, that 1 ventured to complain of it to the Resident, and the other two Gentlemen, Le Cerf and the Secretary. The Resident, with becoming spirit, reprimanded the soldiers; but it produced so little effect that I could not help entertaining suspicions that le Cerf connived at these practices, and shared the advantages which they produced. I suspected him also of selling arrack to my people, of which I complained, but without redress, and I know that his slaves were employed to buy things at the market which his wife afterwards fold to us for more than twice as much as they cost. The soldiers were indeed guilty of many* other irregularities: it was the duty of one of them by rotation to procure the day's provision for the whole guard, a service which he constantly performed by going into the country with his musquet and a bag ; nor was the honest providetor always content with what the bag would contain, for one of 3 H 2 them,"}, {"page_label": "Seite 420", "page_text": "420 CAPTAIN CARTERET's VOYAGE 1767.

When this was reported to me, I thought it so extraordinary that I went on shore to fee the breach, and found the poor black people repairing it. On the 26th, a sloop laden with rice was sent out from this place in order to land her cargo at Macassar; but after having attempted it three days she was forced to return. The weather was now exceedingly tempestuous, and all navigation at an end from east to west till the return of the eastern monsoon. On the same day two large stoops that were bound to the eastward anchored here, and the next morning also a large strip from Batavia, with troops on board for the Banda Islands; but none of the crew of any of these vestels were suffered to speak to any of our people, our boats being restrained from going on board them, and theirs from coming on board us. As this was a mortifying restriction we requested Mr. Swellingrabel to buy us some salt meat from the large strip ; and he was so obliging as to procure us four casks of very good European meat, two of pork and two of beef. On the 28 th a fleet of more than an hundred fail of the small country vessels, called Proas, anchored here; their burden is from twelve to eighteen and twenty ton, and they carry from sixteen to twenty men, I was told that they carried on a fishery round the Island, going out with one monsoon, and coming back with the other, so as always to keep under the lee of the land: the fish was sent to the China market, and I obseived that all these vessels carried Dutch colours.

At this time, we had the two westermost of the Tonyn Islands in one, bearing N. by W. at the distance of somewhat more than four miles from the nearest. This is a very dangerous shoal, and is not laid down in any chart that I have seen: it seemed to extend itself to the southward and westward, all round the two westermost of these three istands, for near six miles, but about the eastermost istand there seemed to be no danger; there was also a clear passage between this island and the other two. The latitude of the eastermost and westermost of these islands is 5° 31' S. The eastermost is distant thirty-four miles due west from Tonikaky, and the westermost lies ten miles farther. In the afternoon of the 25th, we found the water much discoloured, upon which we sounded, and had five and thirty fathom with soft mud; soon after we went over the northermost part of a shoal, and had no more than ten fathom, with soft mud. In this place, where we found the water shallowest, it was very foul; it seemed to be still shallower to the southward, but to the northward of us it appeared to be clear. We had no observation this day, by which I could ascertain the latitude, but I believe this to be the northermost part of the shoals that lie to the eastward of the island Madura, and in the English East India Pilot are called Bralleron's Shoals, the fame which in the Dutch charts are called Kalcain's Eylandens.

We had now great reason to congratulate ourselves upon our situation, for during the whole of our passage from Celebes, the ship admitted so much water by her leaks, that it was ail we could do to keep her from sinking, with two pumps constantly going. We found here eleven large Dutch ships, besides several that were less, one Spanish ship, a Portuguese snow, and several Chinese junks. The next morning we saluted the town with eleven guns, and the fame number was returned. As this was the birth-day of his Britannick Majesty, our Sovereign, we afterwards fired one and twenty guns more on that occasion.

The Governor, although the servant of a republic, takes upon himself more state, in some particulars, than any sovereign prince in Europe. Whenever he goes abroad, he is attended by a party of horse guards, and two black men go before his coach, in the manner of running, footmen, each having a large cane in his hand, with which they not only clear the way, but severely chastise all who da not pay the homage that is expected from people of all ranks, as well those belonging to the country as strangers. Almost every body in this place keeps a carriage, which is* drawn by two horses, and driven by a man upon a box, like our chariots, but is open in front: whoever, in such a carriage, meets the Governor, either in the town or upon the road, is expected not only to draw it on one side, but to get out of it, and make a most respectful obeisance while his Excellency's coach goes by ; nor must any carriage that follows him drive past on any account, but keep behind; him, however pressing be the necessity for haste.

These ceremonies are generally complied with by the Captains of Indiamen, and other trading ships; but having the honour to bear his Majesty's commission, I did not think myself at liberty to pay to a Dutch Governor, any homage which is not paid to my own Sovereign : it is, however, constantly required of the King's officers ; and two or three days after I came hither, the landlord of the hotel where I lodged told me, he had been ordered by the ffiebander to let me know that my carriage, as well as others, must stop, if I should meet the Governor or any of the Council; but I desired him to acquaint the ffiebander that I could not consent to perform any such ceremony; and upon his intimating somewhat about the black men with sticks, I told him that if any insult should be offered me, I knew how to defend myself, and would take care to be upon my guard ; at the same time pointing to my pistols, which then happened to lie upon the table: upon this he went away, and about three hours afterwards he returned, and told me he had orders from the Governor to acquaint me that I might do as I pleased. The hotel at which I resided is licensed by the Governor and Council, and all strangers are obliged to take up their abode there, except officers in his Majesty's service, who are allowed private lodgings, which, however, I did not chuse.

It was happy for me that I was able to procure a supply of English seamen here, otherwise I should not at last have been able to bring the ship home, for I had now lost no less than four and twenty of the hands I had brought out of Europe, and had four and twenty more so ill, that seven of them died in our passage to the Cape. On the 20th, we anchored on the south east side of Prince's Island, in the Streight of Sunda, and the next morning, I sent out the boats for wood and water: of water, however, we could not get a sufficient quantity to complete our stock, for there had not yet been rain enough to supply the springs, the wet monsoon having but just set in. At this time we had the wind so frelh from the south east, which made this part of the island a lee-sliore, that I could not get under fail till the 25th, when, it being more moderate, we weighed, and worked over to the Java shore. In the evening, we anchored in a bay called by some New Bay, and by others Canty Bay, which is formed by an island of the same name. We had fourteen fathom water, with a fine sandy bottom. The peak of Prince's Island bore N. 13 W. the westermost point of New Island 8. 82 W. and the eastermost point of Java that was in sight, N. E. Our distance from the Java lhore was about a mile and a quarter, and from the watering-place a mile and an half. New Bay is the best place for wooding and watering of any in these parts : the water is extremely clear, and so good that I made my people stave all that we had taken in at Batavia and Prince's Island, and supply it from this place. It is procured from a fine strong run on the Java shore, which falls down from the land into the sea, and by means of a hoase it may be laded into the boats, and"}, {"page_label": "Seite 441", "page_text": "ROUND THE WORLD. 44i and the casks filled without putting them on shore, which renders the work very easy and expeditious. There is a little reef of rocks within which the boats go, and lie in as smooth water, and as effectually sheltered from any swell, as if they were in a mill-pond; nor does the reef run out so far as to be dangerous to shipping, though the contrary is asserted in Herbert's Directory ; and if a ship, when lying there, should be driven from her anchors by a wind that blows upon the shore, she may, with the greatest ease, run up the passage between New Island and Java, where there is sufficient depth of water for the largest vessel, and a harbour, in which, being land-locked, she will find perfect security. Wood may be had any where either upon Java or New Island, neither of which, in this part, are inhabited. 1768. September. Friday 2;. Having in a few days completed our wood and water, we weighed and stood out of the Streight of Sunda, with a sine fresh gale at South East, which did not leave us till the island of Java was seven hundred leagues behind us. On Monday the 23d of November, we discovered the coast November, of Africa ; at day-break on the 28th we made the Table satuSay^g Land of the Cape of Good Hope, and the same evening anchored in the bay. We found here only a Dutch ship from Europe, and a snow belonging to the place, which however was in the Company's service, for the inhabitants are not permitted to have any shipping. Table Bay is a good harbour in summer, but not in winter; so that the Dutch will not permit any of their vessels to lie here longer than the 15th of May, which answers to our November. After that time, all ships go to False Bay, which is well sheltered from the north west winds, which blow here with great violence.

At this place we breathed a pure air, had wholesome food, and went freely about the country which is extremely pleasant, so that I began to think myself already in Europe. We found the inhabitants open, hospitable, and polite, there being scarcely a Gentleman in the place, either in a public or private station, from whom I did not receive some civility; and I should very ill deserve the favours they bestowed, if I did not particularly mention the First and Second Governor, and the Fiscal. The recovery of my people made it necessary to continue here till the 6th of January 1769 ; in the evening of this day I set sail, and before it was dark cleared the land. On the 20th, after a fine and pleasant paflage, we made the island of Saint Kelena; and set sail again on the morning of the 24th. At midnight on the 30th, we made the north east part of the Island of Ascension, and brought to till day-light, when we ran in close to it. I sent a boat out to discover the anchoring- place which is called Cross-hill Bay, while we kept running along the north east and north side of the island, till we came to the north west extremity of it, and in the afternoon anchored in the bay we sought. The way to find this place at once, is to bring the largest and most conspicuous hill upon the island to bear S. E.; when the ship is in this position, the Bay will be open, right in the middle between two other hills, the westermost of which is called Cross-hill, and gives name to the Bay. Upon this hill there is a flag-staff, which if a ship brings to bear 8 . S. E. 4 E. or S. E. by E. and runs in, keeping it so till she is in ten fathom water, she will be in the best part of the Bay. In our run along the north east side of the island, I observed several other small sandy bays, in some of which my boat found good anchorage, 4"}, {"page_label": "Seite 443", "page_text": "ROUND THE WORLD. 443 age, and saw plenty of turtle, though they are not so con*- venient as this, where we had plenty of turtle too. The beach here is a fine white sand; the landing-place is at some rocks, which lie about the middle of the Bay, and may be known by a ladder of ropes which hangs from the top to mount them by. In the evening I landed a few men to turn the turtle that should come on shore during the night, and in the morning I found that they had thus secured no less than eighteen, from four hundred to six hundred weight each, and these were as many as we could well stow on the deck. As there are no inhabitants upon this island, it is a custom for the ships that touch at it to leave a letter in a bottle, with their names and destination, the date, and a few other particulars. We complied with this custom, and in the evening of Monday the ist of February, we weighed anchor and set sail. On Friday the 19th, we discovered a ship at a considerable distance to leeward in the south west quarter, which hoisted French colours; she continued in sight all day, and the next morning we perceived that sire had greatly outsailed us during the night; stie made a tack however in order to get farther to windward, and as it is not usual for ships to turn to windward in these parts, it was evident that she had tacked in order to speak with us. By noon she was near enough to hail us, and, to my great surprise, made use both of my name and that of the ship, enquiring after my health, and telling me, that after the return of the Dolphin to Europe, it was believed we had suffered shipwreck in the Streight of Magellan, and that two ships had been sent out in quest of us.

As I perceived that he waited for a reply, I said, that the great ocean, called the South Sea, extended almost from one pole to the other; and therefore although that part of it which lay between the Tropics might justly be called the Pacific, on account of the trade-winds that blow there all the year ; yet without the Tropics, on either side, the winds were variable, and the seas turbulent. In all this he readily acquiesced, and finding that he could not draw from me any thing to satisfy his curiosity, by starting leading subjects of conversation, he began to propose his questions in direct terms, and desired to know on which side the equator I had crossed the South Seas. As I did not think proper to answer this question, and wished to prevent others of the fame kind, I rose up somewhat abruptly, and I believe with some marks of displeasure: at this he seemed to be a little disconcerted, and I believe was about to make an apology for his curiosity, but I prevented him, by desiring that he would make my compliments to his Captain, and in return for his ob- liging civilities present him with one of the arrows that had wounded my men, which I immediately went into my bedroom to fetch: he followed me, looking about him with great curiosity, as indeed he had done from the time of his first coming on board, and having received the arrow, he took his leave. After he was gone, and we had made fail, I went upon the deck, where my Lieutenant a steed me, if my visitor had entertained me with an account of his voyage.

This naturally excited a general curiosity, and with a very little difficulty we learnt that they had failed from Europe in company with another ship, which, wanting some repair, had been left at the Isle of France ; that they had attempted to pass the Streight of Magellan the first summer, but not being able, had gone back, and wintered in the river De la Plata; that the summer afterwards they had been more fuc- - cefsful, and having passed the Streight, spent two months at the istand of Juan Fernandes. My Lieutenant told me also, that a boy in the French boat said he had been upon that istand two years, and that while he was there, an English frigate put into the road, but did not anchor, mentioning, the time as well as he could recollect, by which it appeared that the frigate he had seen was the Swallow. On the boy's being asked how he came to be so long upon the istand of Juan Fernandes, he said that he had been taken upon the Spanisli coast in the West Indies in a smuggling party, and sent thither by the Spaniards ; but that by the French ffiip, in whose boat he came on board us, having touched there, he had regained his liberty. After having received this information from my Lieutenant, I could easily account for M. Bougainville's having made a tack to speak to me, and! for the conversation and behaviour of my visitor ; but I was now more displeased at the questions he had asked me than before, for if it was improper for him to communicate an account of his voyage to me, it was equally improper forme to communicate an account of my voyage to him; and I thoughts 2"}, {"page_label": "Seite 448", "page_text": "0cmm - • ^y-se-- ■' : --g n, -^','i-;\" W-\"T 'VyVrvr. ■*,',, v-.-rv.'^^v K S* £C Jthk4,\" ^' *v \"*f; V s sl'V^fy •-J' JiJL ■*> ti* 1 -$..t.5\" - .-* kta-JJW-jVf- ^ •J' ■*v*-fWfe • .\"-! .i,' '\"-vM <as*X ?"}, {"page_label": "Seite 449", "page_text": "K X /' I.
