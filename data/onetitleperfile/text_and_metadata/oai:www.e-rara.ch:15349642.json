At that time there Were two Ships fitted out, and bound for Genua : the one was called, The St. John Baptist , Henry Chrstanfz . of Amsterdam Mailer, the other, The St . Bernard , John Ben - ntng of Wcfep Yice-Commander, and Herman Voogd of Schiedam. Mailer 3 Over both these Ships was Mr. John CMaas of Dunkirk , as U p- per-Commander. The former was mounted with 28 Guns, the latter carried 26. I hired my self aboard the St I.

Under hopes that this good Weather would continue we set fail , but were no sooner out of the Bay, before the Weather changed , and we now the third time forc'd to look out for a Harbour. O11 the 6 of February we came to Anchor at Portland, where we road three days , and then set fail directly for the Bay of Gibralter , where we arrived on the 10 th ofthatmoneth. Thenextday with a brisk gale we entred the Straits, and with a constant and favourable wind , made Cenua in 15 days, where ai riving we clropp'd Anchor behind the Mold. On the 3 2* we got Prattica , and Licence to unload both the ^ !Vil Ships j which done the Men were paid oft', and difmifs'd. The n ua. Ships, as we said before, were sold to the Duke of Cenua , which lie furnished with Provision of Vi&uals, Powder, Shot and other Ammunition, for 2 years. Aboard each Ship were a Hundred Dutch taken into service, the rest for the most part Italians , amongst which were a few of the Banditti. Here I hired my self for Upper-Saihna- ker, and had 18 Livers per Moneth z although neither I, nor any .else that went before the Mast, knew whither, or upon what Design. Having now regain'd my liberty, I long'd to satisfy my curiosity in taking a view of the Town, with what else was worthy of remark. Cenua is seated on the Sea fide, having a very commodious and com- vefaif plete Haven, on the South facing the Coast of ^Jffrica. The City iion °f . is built partly on montanous and hilly ground, and partly oil a Le- Genu3 * vel, seated between two valleys; and is computed to be about 6 Italian Miles in circumference, being very well and close built, muni- ted with strong Walls, sufficient enough to resist a small Attacqne; :i but would not secure the Town in a long and durable Siege, or violent Storms, without the Militia. Their Militia consists of some \"Dutch and Gorftum Companies, together with a few small Troops of Horse, which are-constantly in motion , either on the Sea-ilde, or thro the City, to prevent, if need require, any silent Attacque, and lupprcfs K lutinies; as also to secure'the Coasts from Tttrkijh and other Pyrats, which sometimes come ash oar in th-eia S-halops ,to get Slaves A 2 and"}, {"page_label": "Seite 35", "page_text": "rets., 164b, fWea Malaga. 4 ~ The Voyages of Iobn Struys.

The City is generally well built with stately Houses and magnificent Structures, more especially on that side which is seated near the Sea: having besides the more eminent Hostels and Public Buildings ,30 fairParsthjChurches, of which that dedicated to St. Laurence claims the priority , as Cathedral.

W ithin land are several steep hills, and on the North a Plain, about a league in breadth from whence reaches out a long Bank towards the N orth-east, and another towards the West , which cause impetuous Breaches of the Sea , and consequently great danger for Ships that fail that way. The Island is almost round in circumference, having its breadth and length almost equal, and is full of small Capes or Promontories, which make so many Inlets. The common Road belonging to this Island , is on the South-west Coast , where you have 15 and 16 fathom Water, and a sandy ground; having the W estern point of the Island at N. and by W. and another Point at E.

This Island is very rocky, high and dry, having litle grafs upon it but what grows in the clefts of the Rocks. It is also very barren of Fruit, neither Lemmons nor Oranges will like there, nor no other fruit whatsoever, unles figs, and those, by reason of the drought of the Season and Ground,seldom ever come to maturity, or return to profit. There are in this Island some Cotton-trees,and good plenty of Goats , so that there are many thousands of those Hides transported yearly from hence. There are also some wild Horses, Kine and Asses > good plenty of Fowl, asPatridge, Heath- hens, Bustards., Wild-geese, and other Fowl, not known with us in Europe.

From the South-west Angle, the coast stretches it self forth 2 leagues Southwest , where there is a small Hamlet, called Pr aye, situated in a commodious place, between two Hills, and environed with 2 Rivers; which running into the Sea , do make two handfom Bays , one whereof is called Porto de Pr aye , and has room enough to contain an hundred Ships, which may safely ride at Anchor, without damnifying each other, having 14 fathom water, and sliot-free from Land, as also the benefit of a small Island, which breaks off the wind. S ailing pa fiPorto de Fraye, before you come at the Town-, is a Cape, or small Promontory , which the Portngeezes call Capo de Tubarao ; On the West whereof is another Bay, called Porto de Ribeirra Corea, which also is very fitly seated between two Hills,and aRiver that runs through the midle, rising from a fountain , about 2 leagues from thence, and disgorging it self into the Sea, by a mouth about a Bow- shot in breadth.

Towards the West, on-an Angle of the Island is a Fortress , two leagues from Porto de Praye , where Ships come to anchor; and North-west from this Angle another Haven 5 known by the name of Porto de Cansts. This Island is very fertile, and abounds with fruit of several kinds, as on each side the Rio de Corea grow great plenty of Co cos, Oranges Citrons, & other Fruit-trees, as also some Cedars.

About 4, leagues South-west of llha del Fuogo, lies llha del Braya, that is, VVtld, or Desert Ijlund , with two or three small Islands, on the North thereof. On the West-side is a Creek, very convenient for such as ha ve occasion to take in water: but the best haven is on the South-east side where it is 15 fathom deep , and a Ship of the greatest burthen may come to anchor close to the Kay. Above this Harbour is a Hermitage, and a Village very well peopled. This Island is also fruitfull enough, having good store of figs, Mulberrys, Water-Melons, and Indian wheat, but far inferiour to Mayo and St, lago for cattel. The Air of these Islands is generally unwholsom, so that the inhabitants are very subject: to Feavers, Aches and Fluxes.

A litle before the evening we came with our Boat close to the Ihore, where we heard a most terrible Noise, occasioned by an impetuous and continual beating of the billows through the cleft of a Rock, which was so loud that we could hardly hear one another speak.

Whoredom is in some regard dispenced with ( or at least connived at ) nevertheless they are not much inclined to Venery, but content themselves with such as they are ingaged to by Wedlock : and in their honest demeanor towards their lawfull Consorts ( of whether sex it be meant _) may convince most of us, that profess the Faith of Christ : The conjugal Love of Man and Wife is so mutually observed on both sides, and the filial Duty of Children towards their Parents , so reciprocally paid, that some who pretend to a more than natural Light,need not to reckon those too mean a precedent for Morality. The parents are very carefull to educate their children , when they are young, and the children diligent in nourishing and providing for their parents, when they are grown aged, and unable to help themselves. A Batchlour desirous to marry,and consequently having settled his thoughts upon a Maid, must address himself (or send some friend) to the Father of the party, or having none,to her Guardian, and not the Maid her self, with whom they may not converse; and these are to treat together upon the matter. But it is more usual, that the Parents of both the parties make the Overture,among themselves. They have no respect: to Consanguinity or Affinity, but marry sometimes with the nearest relations they have , Brother and Sister only excluded, unless they have different Mothers. But to strangers they rarely marry, although it were to a Family of a better rank or Fortune. They look much after Wealth and Beauty , but not so much after vertuous Inclinations, as we do; neither are they prone to be led aside with affability , or flattery , as sometimes happens among us, which tends frequently to a future discontent and irrevocable calamity. 1650.

These at the passing by of the Herse, threw Oranges among the common people; in some of which were # Ficols , and -f* tJWafes. . * whieh this occasioned such a throng of People, that several lay under foot, o/Joney and 7 Persons trodden to death. When they were come to the Altar, the Corps was taken down by the UHandorins , with Waits and Wind- 8-r iw- Music , which made a melancholic noise ; and was carried with great Solemnity to the Altar; where it was set down, and laid round with aromatic Woods, and Drugs , amongst which was poured ticoi. many forts of perfumes and odorous balsams. When this was done the Princes of the blood , and the Mandarins returned to the Kings Palace j but the Ladies were injoyned by the Emperour to remain at the Altar and bewail the Dead, for two days longer; at which time the Bodie was to be burned: and accordingly they stay'd there till the time was expired , striving , who could manifest the most sorrow* hoping so to obtain the greater favour from the Emperour. But the greatest folly I could observe among them was , that when any of them could not dissemble , or let down tears, they were whipped with thongs , by some persons , thereto appointed, till they wept indeed ; and this was duly executed without having regard to their Persons.

There is a certain Creature on this Island which the Hollanders call, tJ&H T aj ovan; that is, The Devil of Formosa. Being about 2 foot long, and 5 inches broad upon the back, with scales all over the body; it has four feet with sharp claws , a sharp long head , and a tail thick at the rump and smaller towards the encflikea Crocodil.This litle beast feeds only upon Pismires , which he catches by laying his Tongue upon a Hill, where they come to feed upon a slimy matter , that runs out of his niouth , and that holds them so fast that they cannot get off again: When he thinks that he has enough, he draws in his tongue and devours them. It cannot do any harm unless to the Ants , which are its natpral .food, but if he fee a man come towards him, either runs into the Earth , or rolls himself in, like a Hedghog : so that to call it a Devil seems a great improperty. T his Great Description of a Litle Creature , we thought not altogether impertinent , because it is a Creature proper only to this Island.

Their men are mostly well bodied and lusty, especially those in the Valleys j and Chan^pane Countreyj but those that keep themselves in the Hilly part of the Island, not so big of stature. Their W omen are but short in Comparison of the Men, yet are staring beauties having a Full face, great Eies , a fiat Nose , long Ears with breasts hanging down like a stitch of Bacon, and would have hana- som beards too , if they did not pull up the hair by the roots. The tips of their ears they bore through, and screw them flat with a horn, made for the purpose, which they think stands wondrous neat. Finally, I hold it uncertain whether^this Island has had the name Formosa ., seriously from the Land it's self, or Ironically^ from the monstrous People that Inhabit it. During the time that I was at F ormosa , I heard often of Men with Tails: to which I never gave much heed, looking upon it as fabulous. Yet I will assure the Reader by all lawfull asseverations, that I found it truth. For it happened that a Yormosm of the South-Countrey was apprehended for an inhuman Murther , committed upon a Clergy man. Aster the matter was examined and the Party pronounced guilty, he received Sentence to be burned. The day of Execution being come j the Murtherer was brought forth, and tied to a pale; As soon as his cloaths were stript off, we saw his Tail, which was about a foot long, and all grown over with Hair * some of my acquaintance out of their curiosity, went to see him , before he was executed, having heard that he had a Tail, and learned from him, that all, or most, of the South Inhabitants had Tails. But as to the certainty of that, I can not fay much , for that , not understanding his Dialect, they might be mistaken; only of this I solemnly aver that I am an eie-wittness to it, and would be loath, to impose it upon any man's beleef if it were not truly so. Upon Festival days when the F ormofans go to present themselves before their Idols they hang great round boards almost like Trenchers to their ears, which are artificially painted : others hang Shells full of Small holes , which loll over their breasts : but upon other days they let their ears be naked, and without any ornament at all. Their Hair is jet-black and long: some of them wear it as we do in Europe ; others tie it up above the crown of the head, after the old Chin a failiion , or plated.

The Women of CHidag , $oeten Nome, and Lumen are of a brown-y ellow complexion. They are generally of a subtile and acute witt , endued with a good memory , and tractable enough to learn any Science; but beyond all other Indians flexible to Christianity. In the Summer-time they are attired onely with a cotton cloath, wide about the shoulders like a sheet, and tied by two Corners athwart the brest : It is also girded about the middle, and so hangs down to the calf of the leg. Their shoes, which are rarely worn among them, are made of Goat-skins , fastned above the foot with thongs. But in the Winter, they*wear Garments of Furrs, as SkinnsofTygres, Leopards , Bears and Apes. Those of Soulang were formerly appar- relled as Europeans-, but all the rest as chmeez.es . Before the first coming of the Spaniards into that Island , the Natives were all nakedf like as now, those that inhabit the Hill-countrey , which wear only a cloth about their middle. The Habit of the Women doth not vary much from that of the Men, only with this distinction, that their Robes are wrapped about their leggs and made fast; and sometimes an upper coat which domes only to the knees: About their head they wear a black Towel knotted before , w hich looks like two Horns. Every woman has a Fig which follows her like a dog. The Men have sometimes their back, brest, and arms painted with a kind of colour which never goes out so long as they live. About their necks they wear Glass-beads , and Bracelets about their arms. Others have great iron hoops , which reach from the wrest of the hand to the elbow , having such small crevises where they open, that it seems a wonder how they get them put upon their arms. About their leggs they wear a string of white fliells, neatly hung and set in order, that at a small distance it would be taken for Lace. The Men of 'Tokkadekol wear a long Reed , which is made fast to their Gircfle behind , and comes bending over their head; to which they hang a Silk Pendent (or streamer} about 2 palms broad, and 20 long.

But above all other faculties surpass any that ever I have seen at running no horse being able to hold with them for a stretch of 6 or 8 leagues together: and wherf they run, have in each hand a tinkling instrument , with which they ever now and then hit the iron hoop about their arm, to encourage them forward. ,They are wholly unskilled in Navigation, having no other Shipping than a fort of Canoo , that is made out of a hollow tree, with which they go a fishing. This with Hunting is all the employ they follow to sustain themselves. But Agriculture, as I said before, is but litle exercised , partly out of their slothfull inclinations, and partly out of fe!ir of theEnemie, they being continually at Warrs amongst themselves, and hate nothing worse than Peace.

It is seated upon a very \" )eaci * commodious Bay, or Road , sit to receive Ships of the greatest burthen. It has a very magnificent prospect from Seaward, having an ? an infinit number of Towers , Temples and Spacious Palaces, The Houses are mostly built of Wood, for the Ground is weak and frequently subject to Earthquakes , so that they cannot use stone. But the poorer sort have litle Cottages made of Twigs and plaistcr'd over with Clay, as in Brabant, Germany and other Countreys. They are Covered with Planks which shoot far out over the walls like aPent-houfe, to shelter them from Sun and Rain. They have upon each house several Tubs with water, which is kept in cafe of sire, to which such buildings are liable. And certainly were it not for the great benefit of the water running through the T own in Ditches, as it does in most Towns in Holland : it would-be suddenly reduced to ashes and for this reason have they built several Houses of Stone where to secure their Goods upon such occasions. The Houses of this City are uniform , and the streets regular, there being 88 Streets, each 400 foot long, which are are all fenced off with Palizados at the end, and Lant- liorns set up. Here they have also their watch-houses, and none are suffered to pass by night ; no not to fetch either Doctor or Midwife, without a Pass from the Governour. This Watch is set alhvays at 10 a clock, after which hour few people are seen upon the streets. This is a good means to prevent Mutiny and Theftbut is a great inconvenience if Fire do happen to break out; for no street or Ward cam have the Assistance of another in such cafe: besides the great danger that the People themselves are in, being sometimes so narrowly pen'd ■ up. An Instance of this happened in the year 1646, when a dreadful! sire happened in a house where several Dutch had their lodging, which on a sudden had consumed a great part of the Street and several Houses on both sides, burnt down to the Ground.

About 6 English miles from the City is a Beacon for direction of Marriners by night, there being many Rocks toward the South that are often the occasion of Ship-wrack,and is therefore called Malhora. These Rocks do cause impetuous breakings of the Sea, which yet render the entrance of the Haven more free and secure. So that Ships and Galleys may ride safely at anchor in this Road.

This City is reckoned about 7 miles in compass , and enjoys a subtile and whelsom Air, which renders the Natives and Inhabitants more acute and of a sharper Genius than those that Inhabit, or are born in places of a grosser : The City which is divided by the River , is again united by four stately Bridges, which so beautify the Town that perhaps gave Charles the Arch-duke occasion to fay,that this was a City only to be seen on Holy-days. The fertile Hills and rich Valleys wherewith it is environed,affoard the Inhabitants plenty of all necessaries. Here is the Court and Residence, of the Duke j The Palace being one of the most magnificent in all Italy, yet far more spacious and splendid within than without: but to recount the spacious Halls , Pompous Antichambre , Marble Statues and Pictures in the Galleries, with all it's Appendencies, were an endless labour. Right over against the Pal lace is a Lifeguard, consisting of a hundred Germans. Before the Palace is also a very stately Fountain , adorned with huge Statues both of Marble and Brass , out of which springs Water , being all in emblematical representations. Upon the Mercato Tporo is a very sumptuous Building in which the Citizens, meet and treat about the affairs of Merchandise, The Palace of the Medici is a stupendious Fabric, and for artificial carved works, afwell in Wood as Stone , and Pictures of the most eminent It dim Masters, seems to simulate the famous Vatican. Besides these are many other inferior Palaces , Public Puddings, Churches, Chappels and very spacious Cloysters , all which would take up some moneths to make an exact survey of. In many streets are Galle- - ties or Piazzas , (as in Coyer.t Garden , ) where one may walk to avoid either Sun or Rain. Here are also many Houses built for Charitable uses, where the Sick are relieved with what they stand in need ofjand every one of those Houses kept very neat and clean, especially the Hospital adjoyning to the Church ^IU T^uncuta. Yet above the many famous Structures which grace Ylorence, the House of Prattelino outbraves them all, which was built by F rancts de lMc diets.

In one of these stand 2 costly Beds, one for the Duke, and the other for the Dutchefs. The rest of the Chambers are hang'd with Tapestry , and some with Cloth of Gold, unspeakably rich ; and illustrated with artificial and costly Statues, which are set in convenient Places thereto ordained. 1 n like manner when we went up another story, we found j6 Chambers more, paralel with the Platform of the former.In every one of these was a stately bed, the meanest whereof is computed to have cost more than a Thousand Crowns. Comeing out of the Pallace you come alia Grotta , which is a fair Arch having therin a Fountain, that seems rather to be Natural than performed by Art. Round about the Fountain are Snakes , Adders,Lizzards and other Serpents,so artificially made inBrass that they might betaken for Living. On each Pillar stand Organs, which are moved by the force of Water , in such manner, that they make a most lovely and sweet Harmony. The Walls arc in several places so thick set withGems, Coral and other things of value,that they cannot be perceived. The rest is set with Marble. About the middle stand fair Alabaster Tables , to which if you draw near, the Water rises from under your feet,and sties all over your head and bodie,but indeavoring to shun it, you are again saluted after the same manner from another place. On the other fide is another called Grotta Sibylla, which is also very costly,and set out with many fairStatues of Marble and Alabastre, richly adorned with Coral., where are also curious Water-works, none ever coming there but is wet with those subterranean Showers. On your right hand is the Bath of the Prince, which is under full of holes, through which the warmth can come to cause Sweat. Besides these there is a third Arch, which is for the Heat in Summer , whither the Duke and his Houstiold retire to refrigerate themselves. In this Arch,is a fair large T able of Alabaster,and at each end several Holes,in which they set their wine to cool. There is belonging to this House a pleasant Garden., wherein are many Springs and Ponds: and every rare and choice Tree that will like in that Clime. Behind this Garden is a Park,full of strange Birds and Beasts , and therein a stately and de- ' ^ *"}, {"page_label": "Seite 108", "page_text": "Chap.I.

Right over this aforesaid Garden is yet another, in the middle whereof is a Chappel, where the Duke for the most part goes to Mass, and Vefpers. This Chappel is built round, after the manner of the Heathenish Temples of old, planted round with Cypress trees,and has all its inner works of that W ood. N ear to that stands an Image of rq foot high, which will represent Neptune, or ihens , made of White marble, from whence all the Waters in the Fountains have their Rife : upon which if a man stands he hears a wonderfull murmuring and buzzing of Water from below. This City is a place of great Traffic and Commerce, especially in Silks and Velvets , of which I saw many rich shops upon the Pome Vecchio , or Old Bridge. The Florentines themselves are very able and skillfull in the Affairs of Merchandise, and very litle Traffic don in Italy wherein they have not an interest ; so that Pope Clement VI called them the fifth Element. Besides their domestic and exotic Trade, they have given encouragement to, and bred up many, ingenious and famous Masters in Architecture,Painting,Carving and other Practical Sciences and Arts , and have for a perpetual memory and Gratitude so many stately Pallaces , Churches, Pictures and Statues left them to Posterity. This City is also very Courtly in respect of it's Situation , through which all Ambassadours and Ministers of State from forreign Potentates must pass , intending for theCourt of Rome , or Seignory of Venice. It is much frequented, vifitedand likewise inhabited by many Private Gentlemen , who spend their Estates here, and is a choice place to live in as well for Artificial as natural Delights , for such as have an Estate to bear it out with. However, I had litle reason to complain of bad measure during the few daies I staid there. For meeting accidentally with a Monk, who seeing me to christian- be a Hollander , did not only caress me all the time in such manner that ^wk. I needed not pay any tiring either for Lodging or Diet, but also fhow'd me all what was remarkable about the City. This Monk understanding that I was short of Moneys , and intended for Venice, procured me q Rix-dollars , which was as much as I had occasion for, to bear my C harges thither. fufefiom On the I st - of 'March I left Florence \" and took my leave of the ii 0 / e ncc Monk,"}, {"page_label": "Seite 109", "page_text": "7i The Voyages of lohn Strays.

Bologne lies about 44 degr. being a Town of small circumference, vet wealthy and full of Inhabitants. The form of the City seems to resemble a Ship whereof the Tower d' Apnelli is. the Mast. It has ever been a Maxim among them not to suffer either Cittadelor Fort to be built, under the specious name of Fortification, beingjealous that under such a colour they might check the Citizens at their pleasure ; So that the Boloaneez.es have nothing to rely .upon, than only the Walls, and valour of their men. The City is founded on the Banks of the famous Savona ,, which River incorporates with the Rheno a litle above F err ar a , by which way all Goods are conveighed. T he Air is here for the most part moist , which renders the circumjacient Couiitrey very fertile, there being the best Meadows and Arable ground in all Italy. There is also v cry good Wine, Olives and Oil: although Fifii they have none except what is brought from afar ; but Venison in great abundance. In this place are made such Sausages , as are sent abroad for great rarities, which some would perswade us at home are made of Affes flesh : but my curiosity induced me to make such examination of that matter, that I found it otherwise; for * Yet no- they are made of* Pork and Mutton.

The Houses on the outside seem as if they were quite gone to decay , yet within are very sumptuous and costly, quite contrary to those in most places in Spam , that I have seen , where every House by the Frontispiece seems rather a Palace than a private Dwelling,yet within nasty, full of spiders-webs , and void of Utensils , pure Emblemes of Hypocrisy. During my aboad there 1 found not any thing extraordinary, as worthy of Remark, unless the Tower of Garisenda , which is built crooked on purpose , for a proof of Art : although some hold the Churches of this City ( if taken in general} to surpass all others in any particular Town in Italy , more especially in regard of the many and rich Images , both of Gold and Silver , but their ground"}, {"page_label": "Seite 110", "page_text": "r >wto. ll ntocl\" >ity. \"mfoc*. ferns t) I:t idelorfu fegjeat, •their pit Mojlyti 'theBjri; 'fe Ac; 1.

A Fter I had staid 2 days at Bologne , I set forward for Ferrara , where being arrived I found it a dead Town , having nothing of Trade; but On the contrary many places void and unbuilt, a sure and evident token of the declining condition of that City. Notwithstanding all that, there are many curious Structures in Ferrara , especially on the River Po , which runs that way, and expatiates it self in T ren- ches or Ditches through the Town. It is strengthened with many strong Bulwarks and Ramparts , and has many spacious and airy streets , with Piazzas on each side along the Houses. Besides this, I could not find any thing worthy of remark, and certainly it was no time for me to consume my small Estate upon such unprofitable Pleasures.

Nevertheless I knew that I could list my self when I would , and receive advance-money : and after a litlc Inquiry, met with Monsr. 7 heodore de Haan , Commander of the Golden Cock , who took me on as Sail-maker. It was not long before the Ship was in her due equippage, and set forth in order to joyn with the Ar- made of Venice , which was upon an Expedition against the Turks in the Dardanelli.

On the 2.0 ditto we arrived at Xante , where we supplied our selves with fresh Water , and took in some Pipes of Wine, which is here exceeding good, and tolerably cheap : for the Banllo , a measure of about 5 Gallon, or rather more , costs but a Scudo , that I suppose is equivalent with 5 s 8 d St er I which again is vended in the Armade for 6 Crowns. On the 22 we departed from Xante directing our course for lMiIo ; and on the 5 th - of (JUay got the heigh th of that Island, but did not touch there , steering directly between Milo and Argentero ; and here we came to anchor , but too near the coast of Argentero , for we were annoyed with mud. Upon this arose a great Storm of Wind, which rock'd us to and again, and at last broke our Cables. We endeavored all we could to get Sea room, but the Wind being towards the Land, drove us slat against the Coast, where the Sieur Adelaar seeing us in such danger, sent osshis Long Boat with 5 or 6 men to fetch a Person of Quality from aboard us, who was a Superintendant of some eminent Place, under the Jurisdiction of the Common-weal th: but all the rest of the Gentry , with about an Hundred Soldiers and Marriners stayd aboard.

However indeavouring to save our Lives, we got fast hold of the Hatch, and won the Shoar. All the rest were drowned to 19 Men , and 2 Women 5 the one whereof was a Venetian l ady, ^ Gemle whose Husband was a Captain in that Expedition. This Gentle- woman woman , after a long and wearisom beating thro the Surges , and ™ ndsr ~ Foamings of the Sea, was thrown mother - naked upon Land, but fervedT moil miserably torn and rent with Nails and Splinters ; having ac-. cording to the report made by the Chirurgeon, above Fifty Wounds . and Holes in her Body : yet notwithstanding all this, was more grieved to hear of the loss or her.

The other Woman that was laved, was the wife of a Privat Soldier, , who was great with child , had driven Six and Thirty Hours upon a piece of the Hulk, and to our great admiration was taken up - alive. It was certain that site could not have endured any longer being already stiffand benummed, and us pale as a Corps.

To this the Governour gave his assent, and with a Ship and 15 men, and some Ammonition dispatched us for the Armade.

However seeing there was as much Danger on the other hand, we chused rather to adventure our selves on land , than to starv aboard: and accordingly 12 Hollanders and 15 Greeks ashoar, and feeing a drove of Cattel we took 6 fat Kine, which we led to the Boat and so got them hoys'd aboard,one by one.

On the 12 dito we Sailed into the River of Constantinople , where we found the Sea-Armade of Venice at Troy, which is the place and remnant of the famous Troy , so much read of in the Poets of old, although it is hard to judge where the Town has verily stood. All that is to be seen, is a Gate which is built of white Marble,and seems to be exceeding ancient , and a small Village with the Foundations of a wall, that encompasse the Town ^7 times , not in circular form, but as it were involved like a Snake, or the spring of a Watch. Towards the Sea are some Trenches and a Redout of Earth ± which have been lately made by the Turks to check the Passage of the Propontis , or Channel of Constantinople.

However the Turks took up as many as they could, andm*de slaves of them. Aboard this Ship was an English Woman who kept a House of Entertainment at Vcmce , notedly known by the name of Mrs. Venters , and one that was very kind to the Englishznd. Dutch when in any strait or trouble, and many ofbur Nation were sorry when they heard, of her Death. The Ship Midleton was mounted with 36 Guns , and 60 Men , whereof about 40 were dro wn'd and burn'd, as we found by the Bodies we took up an hour and a half after the Battel.

While, we lay at Anchor at the entrance of the Channel , and floating to and again before the Dardanelli , the most part of our men were quell'd with a Scorbutic distemper, for want of fresh Water.

It was not long before they came to fee what kind of a Fool , they had got in their Gin, where they found Peel-garlick ready to yield up the Ghost for fear. They brought me first to the Hamlet, where Troy was said to stand in times of yore, and afterwards to those Castles which are built opposite to each other, and command the entrance of the Dardmelli. Here they put me in a Galley, stript off my Robes, shaved my head , and set me to an Oar , which was work enough for six of us to tug at, allowing me only a pair of linnen Breeches to cover my nakedness. I was chain'd to a Rujuan , who had been 24. years in the Galleys : for all strangers that they takeintheJ^e/nwSea-Armadc, are to stay in the Galleys durin g life, without the benefit of Redemption. Which when I came to understand, began in all hast to repent my temerity, and foolhardinefs, and had thought my self more happy if I had been pilling of Turnips or Cucumbers at Durgerdjm , than plucking of such sour Grapes, in a 7 rejau Vineyard.

On the 24. the T urks held themselves close to the Banks near the two Castles, mentioned before (in Pag. 80 ) which tended mainly to their advantage. Besides this they had thrown up two Batteries, one upon the Corner of Barbaria , on the Anatolian Side , and another, on the Greek , or Western Coast , from whence they play'd off their great Guns against the Chrijlian Navy, to work a passage through for their Fleet. Three days long continued they on both sides siring with their Canon , the Admiral of the Venetians , as bearing the chief Standard, riding nearest to the Enemy , and confequenly suffered more dammage than the rest of the Navy : for the Turks threw out great Stones with their Bombs, that they killd three men on a brest, who stood very near the General. In these Castles are Guns of an incredible muslin, and as some say, those in the outmost Redoubts 30 inches diameter. And although there was not any hope of doing the Enemy much harm, yet the Christian Fleet kept still in good Order; waiting greedily for the 'Turkish Navy, which we thought would come out, when ours was a litle more disabled. On the 26 they came out with full Sail, and in good Order, with such a hideous roaring and stiouting, that we could not understand the words of Command, -- nor hear one another speak. Their Ships as well as their Galleys were so stow'd with men, that they were a great incumbrance to themselves. The Wind was now at North, and favoured the T urks so, that the Christians were almost blind and stifled with srnoak : yet the whole Fleet kept their Posts without giving way to the Enemy.

The Venetians did all they could to close up with the Turks , but could not move forward and keep their due Order , thro reason of the Wind, and violent Bf eakings of the Stream, occasioned on purpose by the Turks in opening of their Fleet , that beat Strongly against the Christian Navy. The Enemy in the mean while battered the Squadron of Marco Bembo with an incessant shooting of whole Tears and Broad- iides, that all crack'd again; nor had La&aro Mocenigo , and Gcrclino Malipiero the Vice-Admiral, assisted by the Prince of Parma , the lest share in this hot Ingagement. But beyond all others, memorable was the magnanimous and resolved Valour of Bernardo Bragadim Chieftain of the Contanna , a small, but a well-built Friggat : who notwithstanding the Enemy poured out great shot, like Hail upon her , yet dured all the brunt ofthebattel thundring with her Cannon against the Turkish Galeasses, that they were forced to remove their Post 5 several times.

On this Island are several Capes , the most eminent whereof are Capo delGuardo on the South , and Capo de Tiri on the East .* between which two Capes lies a Commodious Harbour, called Porto de Chietto , which has a good Road for Anchorage at 8 fathom Water. Xante has 45 Villages and Hamlets whereof the most principal lie toward the Sea, to wit, St. Chietto , Littachi *, Pigalachia> tniUin Scuhc ado , Saint Nlcholo and Natte. The last of these has a Harbour sit to receive 100 Galleys. In the hilly part of the Island are several Convents , Cloysters and Religious Houses of the Greek Church, who have also a Bishop here as well as the Romanists , but the Greeks exceed the Italians in number, and consequently have their Religion in greater splendour. You are no sooner come ashoar but you are met by a parcel of leivs , who shall ask you if you have any money to change. These deal in any contemptible Traffic , but especially in Slaves, when any Turkish Saiks, or other Shipping is brought up , by English , French or Hollanders. Xante is of a very fertile Soil and fruitfull, in nothing inferiour senility to Cephalonia , yet exceeds it in Quality and Plenty of Wine , but yet \"/■*\"\"/. scarcer of Water, insomuch that the Inhabitants are sometimes con- strained to knead their Dough with Wine, whereof they make their Bread.

The Land wine. is very populous, and all go armed; so that when the Turkish Corsairs fend some men assioar to take Slaves , do frequently change Fates with them: and for that end the Venetians maintain 70 or 80 Horse,day and night to ride about the Coast.

The Land is very hilly , but the Valleys Venus, rich and fertile, having one Well of very good Water. The Inhabitants are chiefly Greeks , except the Garrisons, and the Governour, who is always a Venetian Nobleman. Candia From Cerigo we set sail for Candia the renowned City of Crete , which now is also called Candia. The Island lies about 4.7 degr. Northerly latitude, and is about 200 English land-miles in length, lying almost East and W est. It has many Creeks, and abundance of fair Cities, of which the most noted are Candia , Canea, Retimo, Sitio, Apicormo, chy> famo , Melipotamo , Gar abuse , besides a great number of unwalled Towns, which they fay amount to 6 50, all the inferior Villages and smaller Granges excluded out of the number. The whole Island has been heretofore under subjection of the Venetians , but at that time when I was there, the Turks were Masters of all except the City Candia it self, which was then under the Venetians and a few strong Holds as appendences on the Town , which they held ( as is universally known) for a considerable time together against the Ottoman Forces. The Fortifications have been and are frequently altered, according to the Discretion of the respective Governours: and is from the very first Foundation famous for it's admirable rare Site, and natural strength. It lies in a fair flat Countrey: the East a kid North Angles fronting the strength Sea. Upon that Angle which lies to the northward was an impre- tfcmdu gnable Fort or Castle, which had not only all the Fortifications that could be thought usefull, or any way advantageous for the Town, but also the Sea for a further strength , which encompassed it as a Mote. The fame Castle has not only the Command of the Haven, but also the Sea on both the right and left side.

The Greeks have also their Churches, but those so mean, that the best which is allowed them is much inferior to the poorest of those which the Romans reserve for their own use. Besides these there is not much in the City worth Observation. As to the long Siege and Storming of this City't were needless for me to give you any account, since it has been from the very beginning traced along, and fully written by others. , The Air of CandU is temperate enough , but on that side facing cUmt, Africa is something hot , and rendred unwholsom by southerly Winds: for which reason most of the Towns are built on that side of the Island which lies next to the Archipelago. The Soil is exceeding soil . good, and all kinds of Grain and Pulse take kindly well, insomuch that sometimes, one piece of ground aftoards two Crops in one year. Yet the Inhabitants are more inclinable to the planting and cherishing of the Vine, which they cultivate with all imaginable diligence, that being far more profitable than the propagation of Grain and other ^ Husbandry, their Malmsey, Red and white Wines being exported everywhere, and reputed the best that Earth can produce. But they have two forts of Malevaise or Malmsey , differing greatly both in fast and quality : the better sort is that which grows about Retimo , that they boil so soon as the Grape is ripe , and are very curious in the preparation and ordering of it ; but that about C andia and Cane a, but ordinary, for there they let the Grapes be rath ripe before they pluck' em, and therefore boil them not: but the Wine that comes N z from"}, {"page_label": "Seite 145", "page_text": "' 102 .

So soon as we had got sight of them , we put out Turkish Colours and hover'd a little, that they might come up to us; which they seeing made all the Sail they possibly could,till they came near us, at what time they began to suspect that they had got a wrong Sow by the tail ,and so indeavoured to go off: but Lascar0 Mocenigo, the General seeing them steer to the starboard, made towards them , and coming within Cannon shot fired a Gun, which did so disorder them, that they thought better to stay together in one entire Fleet and try their valour , than to break their Squadron , and accordingly put themselves in a convenient Posture, in order to receive Battel.

Here are also many Quarries of a rich fort of Marble , and various kinds of Alabastre.

About 7 in the Evening we came to our stage 3 where we were to stay over night. The next morning we broke our fast,yoked the Horses, and set forward; passing over a huge River which had only a Bridge there where we were to pass over, and no where else within 20 leagues above or below: but the Bridge being old and seemingly rotten, we durst not go over all together, but one by one. When we were got over, Evening came on, and the Sky began to grow gloomy, after which followed a very great Tempest that the River swell'd over the Banks and overflows all the flat Lands, which we seeing so suddenly happen , left the common Road ; for that our Land Pilot told us , that the High way was subject: to such Floods with an extraordinary Inundation. After two Hours Storming, the Weather began to clear and the Pilot assured us we were not far from the Town where we were to take our nights rest , and so it happened , for just as he was speaking of it we saw Light, through the Trees, which mightily revived us for we were extreme cold and weary. The next morning we set forward for Pitfiora , and had very good Weather , but came short of the Town that night, insomuch that we were fain to ly all night in the Woods , where we gathered all the Windfalls we could find and laid them on a heap, and with dry Sticks made a huge Fire, which served not only to warm our selves at, but likewise to affright the Bears and Wolves away , which are very bold and cruel in these Parts , as also theMuskettos , which swarm here by Millions, and annoy both Man and Beast, after an incredible rate. \" 0CTOB.

Tis true Pttfiora is no more than a Village, yet for wealthy Inhabitants, Commerce abroad and Advancement of Manufactune , surpasses any City in all that part of the Countrey. In passing through the Town we law many rich Mercers and Drapers Shops; the Markets stored with all forts of Provision, as Corn, Butter, Cheese and Fruits, with a very noble Butchery or Flesh-shambles , and the streets crouding with People from all Parts. So soon as we were arrived, there came several jewelers , who asked if we had any Pearls , or other Jewels to fell or barter. Having refreshed our selves at Pitfiora ; we left the Town the next day about 1 o in the Morning, and about noon entred a large Wood where we found great store of Hurtles or Bilberies , that were far greater and better tasted then any I have known else where ; which moved me to fall a plucking of them; but going a litle way into the Wood, and making a rushing through the Thickets, up starts a huge Bear, which so affrighted me that I had hardly power to run from him ; however it seem'd that he was as fearfull of me as I of him, for when I ran East he ran West, and glad I was to fee his Bear-fhip turn tails with me. This was the only Bear that ever I had seen in Lifeland , or all the way from Riga hither, but the Boors often warned us to take care of our selves, saying that , sometimes both Men and Cattel are devoured with those cruel and ravenous Beasts.

The Town it self gives a noble Prospect: if you view it from without , by reason of the many Parish - Churches and Towers it has, but when you come within, it appears very ugly, the streets are irregular without Uniformity, and the Houses built after multifarious manners, so that the poorest Village, in the Loir-Countreys , is aParadice in comparison of Pletskou 'Tis true they have some Houses of stone, but the most eminent and wealthy Citizens chuse rather to live in Wooden-Houses than in those, for that they fay, The latter are more wholsom.

This is reckoned the best place in all Mofcovia for River-fiffi, especially Pikes and Perch, Salmon they have in great abundance, as also Carp, Bream, and Sturgeon, with other kinds not commonly found in the LoW-Countreys. Novogorod ( which is as much as to fay, ryetp -tow\", or Tiewton, being compounded of the Latin word Novas , and the substantive Gorod , in the Moficovian Tongue, a City) is at this present strengthned only with a Wall of Timber, but well provided with Ammunition, and Brass Ordnance. On the one side is a strong Castle with a high stone-wall, which as then was the Residing place of the Primate or Arch-biffiop of the West-Province, and some other Temporal Lords. The greatest Decorum and Ornament of this City is the Pomp and stateliness of the Churches and some Public Edifices, as at Pletskeu , but the Houses and Private Dwellings of the Inhabitants without any Order or neatness of Structure. Between the Castle and the Town is a long wooden Bridge, where the beforenamcd /van Eastlowit £ , a great Tyrant, threw in some Thousands of the Inhabitants.

It gives a very fair prospect: from without by reason ofit's many Towers and high Buildings. This City is divided into 4. wikes or Wards , to wit, Kitay-gorod , or midle City , Z aar-ox Czar-gorod , the Emperours City,Skorodom and Strelitza SloTvoda. These several Divisions seem rather so many distinct Towns or Cities whereof* Kitay-gorod stands in the middest , and is environed with a high wall, which they call Qrafna Stenna , that is , Red Wall. *ftrhayi It is seated between 2 Rivers, to wit Mofcqua on the South, and the caThiia. Neglina on the North , which are united behind the Palace. The Palace together with its Appendences , to wit, the Wall, Horn- works, Crescents and other Fortifications is the larger part of the Kitay-gorod, called also Crim-gorod ; being welf provided with Men and Ammunition. In the midst of this Palace is a Very stately Church, in which we saw a Silver branched Candlestick , formerly presented to the Czar by the Ambassador of our States. Besides this Church is another dedicated to the Archangel, where are to be seen the Tombs of those of Imperial blood, as also Triotzis Maria and that of St. Nickplas which are both very sumptuous. Those which are in Kitay-gorod without the Palace are also reputed the best and fairest in all M ofcou , being reckoned56. Besides the Churches which are within the Walls of the Palace are 2 very beautifull Cloysters, the one for Young Gentlemen, and the other for Ladies , who have resolved to live a rno- nastichal Life; altho the former may rather go under the denomination of an Ilustrious School, because it is appointed for the Education of the Young nobility in all kinds of Literature and *good Manners, who at 16 Years have a choice pteferred them , whether they will lead a Ghostly or a Secular Life : but that for the Ladies, dispences not with such a Freedom,but all that are admitted must continue durante vita. In the middle of this Palace, or rather Fort , is a high Tower, which the Russians call Ivan Fe like , that is Great lohn being covered with Copper and double guilt. This is that Tower , on whose Top the Emperour Boris GudenoW ( as is to be seen in their recorded Chronicles} brought a Terfian Ambassadour to view the City Mofcou , and amongst other discourse began to speak of the great Loyalty and tnutt, Obedience of some subjects to their So veraigns in past ages : Whence hm ' ,lsna I<- the ."}, {"page_label": "Seite 176", "page_text": "*34 1 j it Voyages of lobn StrUjs.

Besides this there is yet another Tower and one of the widest that ireatBtll ever I have seen in my life, in which is the greatest Bell without doubt in the World, weighing 394000 Ib. and the Clapper 10000 Ib. I measured it and found it 2 3 foot Diameter , and 2 foot solid mettal. It is as much as 5 o strong men can move, and that only so as may just be perceived. It is seldom rung, and that only-upon Festival days , or when any F orreign Prince or Minister of State desires it. When they intend to do it at any extraordinary time , they make proclamation through the Town, by which warning the Citizens take down all the Glasses and Earthen Ware, for it makes all tremble and shake. There are besides the Imperial Court several other spacious Palaces * fox the Boy ar s, or Nobility, as also for the Spiritual Lords , amongst which that of the Patriarch is the most magnificent.

The Third City which is Skorodom , embraces C^ar-gored on the East j North and West-sides likewise in the form of a Crescent. In this City, or Ward, is the House-market, where at a low price you may buy a House, of what greatness you please. These Houses arc made of Square pieces of Timber notch'd and let into each other, which when you have bought you can disjoint and bring it where you list upon Sledges , that amongst many inconveniencies has this one Conveniency, that if a Citizen has his House burn'd he may be every day supplied with a new, which (\"considering the old is brought to Allies ) may without much cost, be placed where the other stood; whereas on the contrary , we are often forced to stay sometimes a year or more before the Rubbish be taken away and a convenient House built in lieu of the old. Besides that conveniency, they have another, which is, that at what time any House happens to take fire, and any , probable danger of breaking out, the Neighbours upon timely notice have their Houses taken in pieces and removed as if they were but Tents. The fourth and last Wike is Strehtza SloTvoda , which reaches out toward the South, over the River Mofcqua^nd towards the Tartarian Countrey. Here is the place where the Soldatesque are inquarter'd, which they call Strelitzen > from whence this Part of Mofcott has it's name. It is very well fortified with Bulwarks , and other Fortifications. The number of the Houses within the four Divisions and the Suburbs, according to their computation are said to be about 95000, the Palace and all its appendencies excluded. The Churches , and Cloysters, wherein they preach are 1700. Amongst this great number of Dwelling - houses you find few or none , but what are altogether of Wood, except some Merchants Houses in Kitaygorod , who as we have already said, build mostly of Stone for the better security of their Goods.

Tis true the Houses are upon such occasions removed with as much ease as ours are blown up , but if the Timber be knotty the Sparks and Cinders sty abroad and kindle other Houses at an incredible distance , which being covered with dry Planks are not so easily extinguished, The Czar upon consideration of the frequent Fires has appointed a party of the Str dithers , to be quartered in feverall places , at a due and convenient distance from each other throughout the 4 Wards ; who are continually to be at hand upon such occasions.

During the time we were there , it was not possible to thwart the streets if they had not thrown great beams and planks across the way. The CAiofcou , and all the whole Countrey towards the North is capable of a very unwholfom Air , for those that are not brought up in it, being in the Winter exceeding sharp and cold , and in the Summer hot and moyst.

Utensils they have not many, but so many as themselves judge needful 1, which are Earthen or Iron Pots, Woe- 1 den Ddhes , Brandy-and Metheglin-Cups , which they rarely rince. As for rubbing and scouring they are meer strangers to it , as ^ also to ornaments and Toys , unless it he a Figure which they call ; St.TijchoUs , or perhaps some other Saint for wJiom they have some particular or extraordinary veneration. Slaves they are by nature, and born to servitude and Bondage, seldom ever aspiring so high , as to I indeavour to make themselves franc , and yet will be excited to | nothing by fair means, or use diligence about any affair, save what ! they are driven to by constraint aiid blows : and yet so sweet this Slavery seems to be to them, that rather than to become free upon the Decease of their Lords to whom they ow allegiance by nature or o- therwise, that they will immediatly fell themselves durmtc vit£ to some other Patron. They are very prone to Theft, yea and to Murther when they think that they can do it clandestinly, or to any advantage, howpoor soever it be , which seems to be primordially occasioned from the Penury of their Lords, who hardly allow them what is retrofit to support and sustain human Bodies : as for Brandy and Tobacco they hold it but a venial Transgression to filch when they can come at it, notwithstanding the strict and severe Laws against Theft, in the lowest nature and lest importance. This only is to be applied to the Vulgar fort, as for those of greater Ability and Rank , they spare not for what tends to a voluptuous Life, and indulge their fences, as much or more than is tolerable. Free they are , and indeed generous enough at their Table , especially when they treat or welcom Strangers, who are very welcom and received with all imaginable Urbanity, on Condition, that they observe the Countrey fassiion, which is to bring a Present with them , that may countervail more than thrice the value of what is set before them: and this if you forget to bring, you may take my word, they! forget to make you welcom.

Their Bread is mostly of Course Ry. As for Fish they eat it rather pickled than fresh, which is plentifull in their Markets , and by reason that washing and making clean the shambles is a kind of an Abomination to thole people, you cannot come within a hundred paces of the Market, unless you stop your nose, lo nauseous and hatefull is the smell. Those of the greatest Rank and ability do in general hold good Tables, but eat most Spoon-meat although it were but bread out of Water that Fish has been boil'din. Cru^r is a great Dainty amongst them, but not so high in e- steem, there as abroad. When they have drunk more than well agrees with them, so that their stomach be surcharged, they prepare a certain Dish which they call Pochmelie made up of cold Beef or Mutton sliced very thin, and £>uas : G^as is a Liquor which they use as Beer of which it is made , with a Composition of Water, Beer- Vinegar, Garlick and Pepper : this JVuas being so prepared they put their meat into it,and seeth it a litle,which afterwards they eat with Spoons. The poorer fort have a certain Liquor much in use among them,which they also call J?uas , this is made of Water with a litle Bran and Barley- meal, which according to their ability they temper thicker orthinner. The Gentry drink Beer, that there is very strong and heady , but more commonly Metheglin , which they make of the best Honey, adding Cloves, Cinnamon , Pepper , Galangal , Cardamom and other Spices : This is a very strong and stealing Liquor of it self; yet they think good to mix it with Brandy to make it more effectual. Brandy which they call Wma they covet above all other Liquors , which without any discretion or noted difference is drunk both by Spiritual and Temporal, Nobles and Plebeians, Menand Women, Young and Old , and that at all times of the Day, before and after Meals; Sometimes to add a medicinal vertue they put a litle Pepper amongst it. Nay, so besotted are the Vulgar with Brandy , that in the sharpest Weather , they will not only part with their Caps or Coats for the Reckoning, but likewise with their Boots, Shirts and Stockings, so that I have seen some of them come mother-naked out of the Kaback or Tipling-House, The Common people were formerly so irregular and void of Order that they would drink themselves full, S 2 and"}, {"page_label": "Seite 184", "page_text": "140 The Voyages of lobn Struys.

They are very covetous of Tobacco, as has been elsewhere said, notwithstanding the Tenure of a Decree or Mandate promulgated about the year 1634 , which strictly forbids every person-of what degree or quality he may be , to smoke it which nevertheless is done privately. The Rufiam are generally gross of Body yet subtile enough in affairs of M erchandise which they can manage very well. T heir Women are much inclined to Gossiping, and bulie Tatlers, often beat by their Husbands , who sometimes use them unkindly : upon which they sometimes address themselves to Court,where the men once convicted over such Crimes are sent to Syberia. The Emperour considering the multitude of Complaints of this nature , has ordained that if any Woman makes complaint without sufficient Evidence, that the Man is to be tortured on the Rack, which if he stands out, the Wife is condemned to exile, her self, before which Law the Court was dayly troubled with such like Differences. ttckbi.

This induces me to a Tale of a young Squire , who thinking himself old enough to be a man, intimated his Inclinations to a common Broker, or Match-maker , withall conditioning beforehand that he would not come to any conclusion with the Parents of his Party, till he had by some means or other got a sight of her Face, which the man promised to do} and accordingly goes to an old Couple who had long intrcatedhim to procure a Husband for their Daughter this said Couple he acquaints with the business who no lest joyfull to understand it pray'd him to hasten the Match : now you are to understand by the way that their daughter had but one eie , which made some difficulty in the carrying on the matter,by reason that the Young man would not venture upon the purchase, unless he saw what kind of a Bargain he had : However the Broker gives her instructions, how to behave her self in pasting by the House where this Youngman was to be, and bad her look alwaies on one side, which ffie did.

Alter they have bathed they come and accompany their Guests, who all the time were merry at Table, in which Humors they continue sometimes a Week, or 10 days,before they depart to their respective Lodgings. The foregoing Ceremonies are such as those of the best rank use, by which you may perceive more vanity than Reason in this Folk: However ! think we have no great cause to hiss at them for their folly, st nee we have as many insignificant Rites amongst ourselves, which are with them equally fenceless and as plain puerility*, as theirs may be esteemed by us.

The Man so going into a Cloyster is capable of Holy Orders, after a certain T erm of years, if he be accordingly qualified.

When they pray they do it not upon their knees as we cfo, thinking that G O D is displeased with such an irregular posture:and when they write they never make use of a T able, altho they have one at their elbow , but alwaies upon their knees; and what they write is altogether in Rolls,pasting one sheet to another as they write them. Fatness they hold for a prime token of Beauty, as also long fore head and eies for which they pull and draw as much as they can to correct nature, which in things of smaller moment they seem to abhor and detest, if a property of other People. About the Sick and Burial of their Dead the Ruffes have these following Customes.

Under the Patriarch are 4 Metropolitans, 4 Arch-Bishops, besides many other Bilhops, Abbots and the Inferior Clergy. The Patriarch is almost Sovereign in Spiritual Affairs,having an absolute and imlnediate power without any appenclency on the Temporal G overnment unless it be in cafe of inducing Heresy, upon which he must Submit to a Synod , as in the year 1662, a General Council was called , and the Patriarch summoned to make his appearance; at what time he was impeached for Innovations , and in- devoiiring to alienate the present condition of the Church and reform it's Government by diminishing Image-worlliip, which he held for litle better than Idolatry. After many days sitting that Council thought fit to confine him, to his Mansion-House , and ordain the First Metropolitan in his room, who was then living when I was at Mofcm. The Revenues of the Patriarch, as alfoof the Metropolitans, are very great, out of whicstthey are obliged to levy and Maintain an Army of 15 000 men, during the time of War. The Habit of the Patriarch, and the Metropolitans differ but litle. The Patriarch has always a great Crosier born before him, or a litle one in his hand and sometimes both , this they call a Pofok. Mitres they wear only. upon Convocations or high Assemblies , and upon solemn Occasions. Abroad they are distinguished by a high Cap, flat at top like the Stvitzers , or Yeomen of the Guard. Next their Bodiethey wear a Cafloc, and above that a long Gown or rather a Pall, which is born up by two Gentlemen. The Inferior Clergy and Priests wear a Cap but not so high as that of the Superiors.This Cap is given them when they are ordained by the Bishops , at what time they shave their Heads, and suffer it to grow no more, save in two litle tufts just above their ears. There is a Law among them that whosoever beats one of those Clerks so,that his cap fall to the ground,he is liable to a very severe penalty (As I well remember to loose his hand ) which nevertheless happens frequently in the Cab etc : but to prevent the worst when a Layman is minded to beat one of those Mushrooms, he first takes off his Cap and then trounces him off so long as he will , which do nehe sets the Cap upon the right Block again.

If a Friests wife come to die before him, he is not only injoyned by the Church to remain a Widdower, but also to leave the Altar, yet not wholly to lay down the Priestly F unction, for he may sit in the Chore or Chauntry and assist at Martins and Vespers , as also at Administration of the Sacraments, as far as it is done without the Verge of the Altar. For this reason the Priests are best matched , as usually making much of their Wives , and treating them more gently than the Laity generally do , lest by hard usage they should drive them into melancholy, and consequently send them too early out of the World, which sends them as suddenly from the Altar. Baptism they hold forth as a Sacrament very necessary , for which o/b^, reason they make as litle delay as may be between the Womb and the Font. If they fear the Child be weak they have it Baptized at home, but never in the fame Room where it is born, for that they hold unclean. TheConsponsors or God-fathers being come to the Church Porch , the Priest meets them and repeats the Benediction. The 'Godfathers deliver 9 Wax-candles to the Priest , which he places round about the Font afterwards turning about toward the East mutters out a Versicle or two, then taking the Incens-pan goes round about the Font, which done he sings a Psalm or Hymn , making a • brief Oraizon, and after that demands the name of the Infant which is delivered him in writing. So soon as he has read the Billet , askes, whether the Child beleeves in the Sacred Trinity ? and , Whether he utterly Forsake the Devil, &c. To which they confidently reply in the Affirmative. Then the Priest pronounces this Adjuration, Get thee hence, than unclean Spirit , and make le ay for the Holy G hoft, Then he takes the child into his Arms, blowing three times in his Face , and making a cross upon his Head, dips it three times in Water, Saying, 1 baptize thee in the T^ame of the Father, and of the Son , and ofthe Holy Ghost.

The first and lightest is the Batt oki , which is when the Patient is to lie upon bis belly, then come two men, one sitting down upon his Neck and the other upon his Leges, who beat him till the Judge or Officer commands them to hold up. The Kmtten is a Punishment of a higher degree, and such as usually those that sell Brandy, Metheglin or Tobacco without a special License from the C^ar , are punished with, and is after this manner : The Executioners Servant takes the patient and strips him from the middle downwards , and takes him upon his back, which done the Executioner with a scourge of Thongs made of a raw Elks-hide dried gives him a certain number of stripes , according to a Ticket which is delivered him immediately before he takes the scourge in his hand. This punishment is exceeding severe, and yet not sufficient to suppress continual smuckling , and selling by stealth , which the more they arc puniffi'd and threatned , the more eager they are to do it. The Executioner and his Office are not there so contemptible as with us , for it is sometimes purchased by the most wealthy Merchants in the Land. Other Crimes are punished with Chapping off a Hand or a Foot, and sometimes only a Finger according to the enormity of the crime. False Coiners have liquid mettal poured down their Throats : and Ravishment of Virgins [ or as our Laws call it a Rase ] is expiated by gelding of the Delinquant* of whichif he recover well and good, but it'is very rare that any does.

The Inhabitants are a rude and barbarous People, utter strangers to good Manners and Learning. They speak for the most part the Ruffian Language, but some places there are where they speak Tartarian , and in other places they have a peculiar Tongue of their own. They are the most stupid Heathens that I have yet seen in all my z Voyages, have neither Sence nor light of a Divine Power. Houses of Worship, and Priests, Resurrection, Heaven and Hell are things they never heard of, nor nor will ever learn to know what they are. However I may not be so general but that I may except some , who have some light and knowledge of an immortal God, and such an one as has the direction of all, but only rules them as a King upon Earth does his Subjects. They are further of Opinion that there are Devils or evil Spirits, whose power is limited and circumscribed , and that they cannot do any mischief save only in this Life , for these doubt much about the Resurrection, and for this end they do Sacrifices to them as do the Madagascars that they should do them no harm. They tell you of a strange Water by the means whereof the Prince of the Devils comes in horrible and most ugly shapes , for which they dread , as Children do Bugbears they never saw. To that Immortal Deity and divine Essence they osser up all manner of Beasts as Oxen , Horses , and Sheep, which when they do, they take the Hide and stretch it out upon a Rack made on purpose,making thereby a Fire, over which they hang the Flelh to boil, When it has seethed long enough, they take out a Bowl of the Pottage in the one hand , and a Bowl of Me- theglin in the other,and throw them both upon the Hide, upon which it falls into the Fire,saying , Accept , 0 God , this offering at my Hands , and be pleased to hear my Prakrs which Praiers do commonly import their own Health, or the increase of their Cattel.

These made not i6G9 ' much delay, but on a sudden raised a mighty Army, which incorporating with the Rebells gave the Vice-Roy battail, and gain'd the Field, and pursuing the success of the day invaded the Emperours Territories. The C:paar in the mean while being informed by Express that the Hostility kept the Field,had put theForces under Conduct: of the Vice-Roy to flight, and that they approached with .a great Body, he levied as great an Army as he could do with so short warning, and mgaged with the Tartars in open Field. But the Hostility increasing more and more, what with their own Nation , and what with the Malecontents within the Rufim Jurisdiction , were almost 15 to 3, and after a short but very hot Battel the Empe- rour was fain to flee and betake himself to Novogorod. The Tartars seeing themselves Masters of the Field., marched-forward to Mofcou .which they attacqued , took in and plundered. However the Cittadel Cremeicna held stoutly forth all the time, without making Proposals or Articles upon which they would seem willing to surrender it , till at last finding themselves not in a capacity to hold forth they gave it over , upon very honourable Conditions as to themselves, but disadvantageous Terms for the great Duke himself, and the CAty of UMo/cott.

Right loath was the Czar to give his assent to the Conclusions of the Treaty, but was at last compelled to sign it with his own hand , partly for that his Bojars and Council pressed him to it , and partly upon his own considerations, how that his Countrey in all probability would in cafe he continued refractory be overrun, and he himself with all his Race be secluded from the Monarchy.

The General upon this Answer sent him the Original of the prementioned Articles , and so willed him to avoid Blood-shed : but the Governour detained the Messengers and kept the Schedule, resolving to stand out the Siege. Upon this the Tartars raised the Siege , and attempted to storm the City; but those within contagiously defended themselves,and plai'd of their Canon; together with an incessant shooting of Arrows,at the Enemy, that they were forced to retreat and remove the Siege to another side of the Town, where some disloyal Rujsians had acquainted them that the place was weakest and consequently the most easy to be storm'd : however finding no hopes of gaining the Town, the Tart man General sent a Herauld to urge the Governour to resign the Papers , declaring himself thereupon willing to draw off his Forces, which the Governour refusing the General left the Town.

When we returned aboard the Mobile followed us with Music and Dancing a good part ©f the way. On the 10 th we reeeived a good Quantity of Lead aboard , which we were to unload at Astrachan. On the 13 th I got permission of the Officers to go up to Cafan to buy some Biscake for my own use , which I had for a mean price , and having much more than I could use, I sold it and got a considerable profit, as well of the Officers as the Foremast men, for we were to take care for our own Victualling.

Some Rufiam had a mind to fee what would come of it, and after long digging and much struggling at last got it turn'dover, but, instead offending a Treasure, met with another Motto , which was, THOU ASS GO SHAKE THY EARS. This vexed them so that they rather willed to let it stand in that posture , than take the pains to set it as it was before, to deceive others. T he Land round about is very fair and withall of a fat Soil, yet not cultivated, for there are no Inhabitants , but the Relicts of several Towns and Villages, formerly depopulated by the famous TamerUn. On the 17 we failed past the River and City of K^Adrobe , lying stl the heigh th of 54 degr. and 48 min. At the mouth of this River \\va were again set fast , and after much labour , and all the means we could imagine to be any way helpfull, we gave the Ship and Yachf both over for lost , but in the Evening it began to Thunder , and abundance of Rain fell, that the River began to swell, and so set us adrift again. On the 2 9 we came before Qalmaka , where were many Salt-pits and two new Towns. We found there several Pans where the Ruffes made their Salt, which they fetch out of great hollows and cavernal Rocks; this being boiled is sent up the fVolga in Strougbs , and so dispersed over the whole Countrey of UUoJcovia. These Salt-pits keep abundance of Men in imployment, and is no small profit to the Overseers. On the 30 th we set sail again , and after half an hours failing ran aground upon a sand, where after much ado we gott off, but with the Loss of an Anchor and 80 fathom of our Cable. The next day it began to storm very hard , wherefore we thought good to come to anchor, for the River was here about very perillous, and so we were fain to continue till the 4, of August.

On each side this River is a fair and pleasant Countrey so far as one can view : but we were ic\"/. informed by the Ruffes that it was there very dangerous to travail by reason of Robbers, and die vagabond Cosaks , who kept themselves in the Woods, whence they sometimes falley out in whole bands,and surprize Passengers. T he Cosaks also haunt the River, having Boats which are made long and filial 1, with which they row admirably swift.

The City is built fourSquare , and mostly of Wood ; only the Churches and Cloysters are built of stone. The day following we saw the Mountain Cofak-knm , so called from the Cosaks which were there beat by the Mofcoy 'ian Army ; having sadly molested all the Countrey. under the subjection of the Cyaar, by a continual Plundering : but having at that time received such an overthrow could never since complete so great a Body, as might be any way obnoxious to the Behind Samara the Mountains are very high, but Cohkkrtm fur pastes all the rest for heighth.

The Knight having killed the serpent it was meta- morphofed into a Rock which is now this Mountain. The day following we came before Saratof , where we cast anchor, This City lies in 52 degr. 12 mitt. in a valley upon a Branch of the VVolga , on the larboard fide in failing down, and is only inhabited by a Military Officer and a Garrison of Soldiers to free the River ana Countrey of the C ofacks and C almuc- Tartars , whose Countrey is bounded here. These Qdmucks are the most ougly and mishapen People in the World , worse favoured by far than the Hotentots or Moors , which are Angels in Comparison of those. Their Faces are broad and almost four square , their noses flat, their mouths reaching almost from one car, to the other, their Lies long and small, upon their Heads they wear a Quoif; the rest of their Habit is sufficiently denoted in the following Plate. They seldom go afoot but mostly on Horseback, as if they were Centaurs, for some of them do not only eat and drink but also steep upon their Horses. Their only weapons isthe Long-bow which they use with an admirable Dexterity. There is a continual enmity between those and the Nagayans , for they perpetually steal one anothers Children and Cattel , which they bring to Ajh ach an to Market, for there they have 3 several market days , one for the Ruffians themselves , another for the T^jgayam , and another for the Qalmuc-Tattars , which 2 last-named may not come together, altho they be both Mahometans , and under the Jurisdiction of the great D tike.

The City is in it self not great, but very strong mu- nited with 6 Ramparts *, or Bulwarks , besides other Fortifications. The Garrison is well maintained with Recruits of Strtlttzers , being a Place of great T rust and Importance, especially for that it lies upon the Tartarian Continent. On the 19 we came before the Place where Cjarefgorod of old had stood, by the Ruins thereof we could observe that City had been ' built of Brick. It was demolished besides many others by TamerUn the Great. The stones have been of good use to those of Aftrachan , wherewith they built their Walls. Towers, Churches and Monasteries. On the 20 we haled over several Rifts and shallow Foords , and at last ran our selves aground upon a sand , where we stuck 3 hours before we could yet clear.

On each side are several Watch-houses, with Towers from whence they can fee the Enemy at a distance , the Countrey being level and not Woody. The first occasion of the building of this City was said to be from a party of40 oCofacks which had\"spoiled a Rufiim Caravan, intercepting it between the Land and the Boats , where the Strelitzers were , that were appointed to Convoy it , and by reason that the stream was so strong that the Boats could not row against it , the said Robbers made their escape with a very rich Booty. At that same time there was at Tzormgar a Perfim Ambassadour arrived with all his Moveablesand a great Retinue, intending for Mofcou. The said Ambassadour came aooard our Ship and received Presents from our Officers , which although he willingly accepted,yet remunerated them with things of greater value and worth. On the 2 2 we set sail and saw the Mountain PeloTmn where the Xuflan Fablers fay the Moon goes every night to bed , because that over that Hill is always a great mist. About 2 in the afternoon we got the Island Kiqier in sight and speeded our course so that we gain'd the sight of A(trachm before the Sun set.

From the day of our Arrival here, we lay off in the stream till the first of September and then came up close to the Kay with our Ship and Yacht, thanking the Almighty for his special Bounty , in delivering us through so many perils, and bringing us at last to our desired Port.

It is a famous Town for Traffic , frequented not only by all the Regions of Tartary adjoyning to the Caspian Sea , but also by Persians , Armenians and Indians , who bring their Goods and Merchandises in a certain fort of Shipping which they call Boeses, being about 80 Tun burthen a piece.

Astrachan at last it self was besieged and taken by storm by the said Great Duke, the Tar tartans driven out , and peopled with Ruftans and a strong Garrison of that Nation. Astrachan, when in posleslion of the Tar tars , wasbutaimall town in comparison of what it now is , for the Father of the then Emperour when I was there had enlarged it by a 3 d part, and called the Addition Strelit^a gorod , that is the Soldier-Tofvn, for it is mostly inhabited by military persons : and since that time it has been continually augmented with new buildings. The Customs and Duties besides the Bartering of Commodities in this Citie is a considerable profit for the C&aar. The Air about Astrachan is very indifferent and tollerable as to it's Temperature, neither rendred unwholfom b v the scorching heat of the Summer Solstice, nor in any cafe insufferable for the penetrating Frosts in the Winter , as if this place had the benefit of two Climats. Hence is the Soil also very fertile and the Countrey fructiferous beyond (I had almost said ) any other Coun- trey in either of the temperate Zones , if the People and Inhabitants had but two Advantages in cultivating it, which tend mainly to the Improvement and maintenance of Agriculture , that is ., an assured constant Peace , and the Mysteries of Husbandry which we have in the WestermostCountreys of Europe, They have many and various kinds of select; Fruits , as Water-Lemmons , Oranges , Apples, Pears, Cherry s, Damzons, &c. The Vineyards are in a short time very much improved, for before the year 1613 that Plantation was not known among them , till certain Perfian Merchants bestowed a Vine upon a German , but a Profelyt and Monk of the Rustuw Church, which he planted in a Garden belonging to the Monastery : the fame Vine thriving so well, caused divers great Merchants to do the like whose indeavours had in the space of 3 years that success, that they presented the Emperour with 2 00Pipes of Wine , and 50 Pipes of Brandy, upon which the said Emperour gave them all the Encouragement he could to propagate that laudable beginning. The Nagayan-Tartars who for the most part inhabit the Champan land about arid near Astrachan , are not permitted to dwell in the City; nor may they fortify their villages with Walls or Towers : only by many Intreaties they have obtained a Grant of fencing in their Tents with Stakes and Palizados, to secure themselves from the Assaults and"}, {"page_label": "Seite 226", "page_text": "11 of 15 Waif H Ddafc isinoi- iDu iHdtr£ \"3tJE Ht; j ilffCD-i tad® E C@ HSU i.wlC fc- Chap.

They have no fast Towns, or Cities, but use Tents, as their Ancestors have ever done. Their Tents are built round, the Diameter of the fund being about i o foot: these are twisted with Reeds or Barks of Trees, and to defend them from the Rain covered with Felt. The C himney is turned round with a Weather-cock* in the midle of the Tent they make the Fire , which is commonly of Cows-dung and smallTwigs dried together in the Sun about which they sit , and as they are ready for a Nap drop down one after another. xiAstrachan being almost on every side surrounded with such a fruit- full Countrey, has good plenty all forts of Fruit brought every day to Market; and those very cheap. Melons I have bought 10 ori 2 for the value of a penny and other fruits after a conformable Price. Fish and Flelh they have in better plenty than any where else I know in the W or Id. For the value of 3 d I bought a huge Sturgeon, a Carp weighing 30 pounds, and 25 Herrings, greater and fatter than ever I have seen in Holland. Pearch , Pike , Bream and Sandaks are there so plentifully taken , that only poore people eat them , of which a family of 8 Persons may have as much as will suffice them, for the va - lue or 3 farthings. The fiffi Sandach is a great Rarity , and proper only to the Wolga , and such Rivers as run into it : being about the bigness of a Haddock, and something like it in tast, but much more delicate and faster , if taken about Noyember and the 3 following Moneths.Their Beef and Mutton is exceeding good,fold usually for a Farthing the pound. All kinds of Water-Fowl are very plentiful and cheap, especially a sort of Wild-gees and those we call Mosco- vy-Ducks which the Tartars take with Hawks , and bring them in such plenty to Market , that they may be had for a peny the dozen. The Tartars who live chiefly by Fiffiing and Fowling use also Hunting, and in several woody Istands about Ajirachan take many Wild- swine which are fed with Accorns, that being known for the best mast that is, for Hogs. These they also bring to Ajirachan which by reason that that Flelh will take Salt well,they buy arid use it aboard the shipping, that trade to and again in the Caspian Sea, the more because of it's cheapness for none but the c Jliofcoyians and Armenians buy it,the Perjtans and Tartars themselves being mostly CMahometans , and therefore not Z 2 per- mir. lSSs."}, {"page_label": "Seite 227", "page_text": "180 The Voyages of lobn S truys.

To be brief, there is not that thing which may l6 ° 9t delight the Fallat, but may be had for a very mean and inconsiderable price, and at a far easier rate than the coarsest Diet which necessitated people must be content with in the West of Europe ; and if any man of a mean Estate could deny himself that Society of his Relations and Acquaintance in which every one has more or less solace, and retire thither, he may live as contentedly there as the greatest Lord, or richest Merchant in the World, who, as it were in taking Honey are frequently stung with the Bee , and in receiving Prosperity and Benefits from the right hand of Fortune, are as often buffeted with her left. However by way of exception I must mind you of one thing, that the Rujsians are here at a great Jwoss for Brandy,since the promulgation of a Late Edict:, the tenure and purport whereof was , That no Brandy should be distilled there for a certain term of Years : but upon •v what insight it was that moved his Majesty to order such an Interdiction I know not > unless to prevent the Strelit^ers , or Soldatesque, to forget themselves so far as to let the Tartars , which ly on every side the City, to surprize them with a sudden Invasion : for Brandy is not only under a special Interdiction of being made there , but also the Importation prohibited to a certain Quantity, every year, which makes the Ruftms the' more to covet it, insomuch that sometimes they have drunk all the Kabacks and Brandy-cellars in Aflrachan dry before.; Moneths of i a be about.

This Skin is held in great esteem by the Tartars and Ruffes , and fold for a good price, as I have paid my fell sometimes 5 or 6 Roehels and doubled my money when I fold it again. One of those Skins is to be seen at the House of Mr. John Spammer dam in Amsterdam , a Gentleman famous for collection of the Rarities of Nature from every place of the W orld : but that of his he had from a Seaman that had been formerly a Slave in china , where coming into a Wood, found of this Fruit, and brought away as many Skins as made him a Coat. The Description he gave of theip, did very much agree with what the Inhabitants of Aftrachan informed me of them. It grows upon a low Stalk about 2 foot and a half high , some higher , and is supported just at the Navel : the Head always hangs down as if it pastured, or fed, of the Grafs , and when the Grafs decays it perilhes , but this I ever look'd upon as ridiculous , altho the Inhabitants asseverated to me by many Oaths, that they have often out of curiosity made experience of that, by cutting away the Grafs, upon which it instantly fades away. However what I might further add as to what they fay of this Fruit, and what I my self beleeve in the won- derfull Operations of a secret Sympathy in nature, I shall rather keep to my self, than aver , or impose upon the Reader , what, I am - sensible will be universally exploded for a Fable, Certain it is there is nothing which is more coveted by Wolves , than this , and the Inward parts of it are more congruous with the Anatomy of that Animal, than Mandrakes are with Men.

They have also some Camels but not many. Their chief Diet is dried Fish which they use in stead of Bread. They have also a way of making bread of Rice, which they knead in Oil and Honey , and so bake it in Cakes. All kinds of Flessi they eat, except Swine, holding Horse-flessi for the best. Their Drink is Water and Milk, esteeming Mares-milk above all other. They profess the Mahometan Religion , and are ot the Perjian sect:. The Czaar allows them Laws and Judges of their own. They are also Tribute-free, but in stead of Tribute are to bring several Thousand men to field upon occasion. CHAP."}, {"page_label": "Seite 230", "page_text": "H Chap. XIII.

But before I treat any thing about that Expedition I shall give you a previous Narrative of an Uproar raised and headed by Stenko Radzin , and then the rest in order. There are two Nations of the Cosacks , the Sapor ok thy , and the Donsky. Ttrojhns The former of these were sometime subjects to the Polish Crown, and keep themselvs about th eBoriftbenes and Kiof, upon 5 o Islands which are environed with that famous River. They call those Islands in their own proper Tongue Porog, which is as much as to fay Stairs, and therefore are called Sa-porogsky. Their work is to watch the Irruption of the Tartars or other Enemies upon the Polish Territories. They are called Cosacks from the Slayonian word Cofa , which is as much as to fay a Spirit, by reason of their admirable celerity of Motion , being always ready at hand upon occasion. T he Donskt or Don - Cofaks are those who live upon the famous River Tanats , by the Natives called Dow, and are properly under the Jurisdiction of the Czar , although more out of their free and voluntary disposition ; for they have been indowed with many Priviledges, as to have their own Princes, Judges and Laws, as also a General of their Armie whom they themselves Elect. As also this Immunity that when a Mofiovian Slave runs away from his Lord, and betakes himself within their Territories, they are not obliged to deliver him up unless themselvs list.

The first occasion of this Revolt ( as himself confessed ) was to rev enge his Brothers death, who was killed by an Eminent Personage, whose name was lurk K^ilexoVitz, Dolgeroeky in the y£ar 1665. The Brother of Radsin was at that time in the service of the great Duke in the Pohsh Warrs , under the command of the before mentioned Bojar, lime Aiexo'mt^ Dolgeroeky , who commanded in chief : and when the Camp broke up to go into their Garrisons, the young Rœdzw desired to be discharged with his Men, having done the Emperour very good service in that last Expedition , and that then there was no more occasion for their Aid : but the General refused to let them go , as not having any certain Intelligence that the Hostility were sent to their Winter-quarters. Th eCofaks were hereat greatly discontented, being Volunteers, and had deserved yet greater Civilities than their Request, or than ever they had received from the Rattans : they therefore marched osssilently , led by their Collonel, brother to this said Stenko Radzin , which was so badly resented by the General, that he took the Collonel, and hanged him. This was the sum and ground of his revolting, which prompted him not only to imploy his Weapons against the Rusiians, but aswell against the Perfims. In the year 166 7 he began to commit many Insistencies and himself and all his crew betaking themselves to the V saiga. , where they took all the small Shipping they met with, and plundered them , killed and threw over board all the Men , -unless they would admitt themselves into their Companie : They entred also all the Towns seated near the River, where they pillaged the Churches and Monasteries. From hence he took his way directly for laik , which he took in and set a strong Garrison. From hence h*c marched toward the Caspian Sea gathering vast multitudes of discontented Persons , who came upon the noise of Rebellion from all parts. From the Caspian Sea he went for the VVolga by the way committing many Insistencies , plundering and sinking all the small Shipping , wasting and depopulating of Cities and Villages , and using the People very inhumanly if they would not resolve tojoynin that Rebellion. From hence he went to the City Ter kit , and so onwards to the Bounds of Persia , where he also sadly molested the Subjects of that King , as well as those of the Czar,"}, {"page_label": "Seite 232", "page_text": "Chap.

Stenko Rad^in perceiving that,sent outEmmissaries to fee where they kept themselves, with Instructions, to tell them that his End was not to do any harm to their Persons or Estates; but only to buy Provision for his Money, and therefore willed them to return into the City. The Persons who were sent did their message , and the credulous Citizens came down entred their Houses, and set open their Shops , of whomand - his followers bought several Commodities and Necessaries paying them to the utmost farthing : but had given a token to his Men by setting of his Cap after an unusual manner , upon which they were all on a sudden to fall upon the Towns-menand massacre them, as after a most barbarous manner they did, sparing neither Man, Woman, nor Child. The mpoode of ^jirachan , whose name was Iynn Simomseit £ Pro so- r of ski , hearing how many places they had defoliated in the Coun- trey of the t~Medes and upon the Borders of Persia, thought it high time to put himself in a Posture of Defence , and suppress the growing Army of the Malecontents; he in order thereto caused all the Shipping as well Merchant-men as others to be put into an equippage, and dispatches Simeum IvamTvits Cehoof, who had then the third Sustra- geo {Astrachw, to find out th zCofacks-Rebells, and give them battail. This Navy consisted of 36 Stroegs , and about 4.000 Men. The Re- bells had already 2 a Stroegs with a proportionable number of Men, keeping themselves about the Island Satyry Boggere , which lies about the Entrance of the Volga into the Caspian Sea, where they had set up a Watch-House upon the Top of a high Hill, from whence they could view the whole Countrey round about, as also th t Caspian Sea and the VVolga? This Island lay very commodiously for their Ends, being all along the Coast of a high solid Rock, and had only one way to enter it.

It was not long before the FFapred Proforofski received Letters from the C&aar, with a Pardon for Stenko Radzin on condition he would submit to the Emperour , and for the future demean, himself as a loyal subject. The subtle Co sack not expecting so gracious a tender, accepted of the Emperours Grace , being already by Hunger and other extremities brought to such a state, that he would of his own accord have requested it, for they were then put to a short allowance, and had taken a Persan Bees having some Horses aboard that were sent to the Czaar , from the King of Persia for a present * these they took, killed and used very sparingly , whence it may be gathered in what a mean condition they were. Having thus obtained an assurance of Pardon from the Emperour , they marched forward for ^srachan , where they were very kindly received, and congratulated by those of the Town, and everyone of them appearing in the most splendid manner he could, for they had rifled many Gentle- mens Houses where they found always Apparrel, Jewels and other Plunder for Habit and Ornament.

This so much weakened them that they were not in a capacity to do any considerable damage by land , the more by reason the Persians watched their Coast with very great vigilancy ; as did also the Cofacks and Dagestan Tartars , so that they were constrained for some time together to keep off at Sea , and keep close to Pyrary , where every one was well warned of them and consequently so cautious that they got but very litle Booty.

Here we were in a great strait not knowing what to do, for we strayed from one Lake to another, and almost ready to eat one another up for vexation. In the mean while the Clouds began to rife, very thick at South-east which we thought did presage storm , as at last it broke outintoa Thunder, wherefore we were forced to put in ata reedy Island , so long as the Weather continued so boystrous. When the storm was over and the Sky began to clear up , we betook our selves to the Water and directed our course to the Southward, where beating along the Coast we discovered a small CncMs,or Tartarian Boat which came directly against us and asked whither we intended; we told them, Forthe Caspian Sea.

This last startled us not a little; however we resolved unanimously hap hazard to venture through, let what would follow , adjudging it equally safe to run that peril, or to suffer the Calamities we were liable to, and had in some regard deserved : and in that resolution continued sailing till we found the Stakes or Pale-work so close in the Mouth of the River , that there was only a narrow Passage to go through. About the end of the said passage we saw a Redoubt, which at a distance seemed to be very strongly fortified, which mainly increased our fears , but greatly to our good luck we found no Watch but onlya few Fishers , who had no Authority , or warrant to examines, insomuch that we steered boldly through; but considering our Bread was almost brought to an end, for we were brought to an Allowance of an ownetper diem , we therefore turned back and prayed the Fishermen to supply us for our Moneys ; but they told us they had hardly enough to suffice themselves , whic hfvery much difheartned us, however they supplied us with Fish as much as we had need of to serve us over the Caspian Meer. On the 14 we set out and left the Wolga , which there leaves it self divided into several streams or Heads like the Nile (as beforej)making so many several Islands , which are low and full of Reeds , except only the Island SatyriBoggore, which is surrounded on every fide with high Cliffs.

All along the Coast we saw abundance of Wild- geese Pelicans and other Fowl which now and then we bestowed a litle powder upon. The strand was all grown over with Reeds, which grow to an incredible heighth, and the Water there we found deeper than off at Sea, insomuch that it were very commodious, in a storm for any small vessel to shelter themselves , dropping anchor a litle without, for the Reeds break of the Winds and the impetuous beatings of the Water. In the afternoon towards the Evening it began to thunder and rain very hard , the Wind was very high at South and by East , and our Course, lay South and by West, The Water all the time beat over the Gunhil, and two men forced to heave out with their Backlers though hardly to any purpose, for notwithstanding all the pains they took the Shallop was still full , the Tempest continuing io till 5 in the next morning , at what time it began to grow very calm and moderate, yet not so but that we were driven with a fine fresh Gale.

The River KiscUr is a Branch , or an Arm of the Bustro , rising about 8 Dutch Leagues above Tcrki, and runs paralel with the ypolga about 65 leagues, so disbanding its floods into the Caspian Sea. But now we were in a more desperate Condition than ever , partly for that our Shallop was so loaden that we were not a foot above Water,and on the other hand wanted bread , for we had not above 6 or 7 pound among all the Company.

We steered directly through the Islands , and when we were about 20 leagues within the Bay, we discovered high land , which we afterward knew to be the famous Caucasus and Ararat , which also border and extend to the Ureas Hills , and sailing alitle further we found that we were near the Quick - sands , so that we were fain to tack about, and bear up to the Channel, where coming we sounded and found it 2 fathom, and a good sandy ground.

They wear gray Felt-coats with a mantle of the fame, which is rough without; this they hang slovenly about the neck made fast with a great button , that they can turn it which way they list, and make it serve fora Buckler against the Wind.

To confess the Truth I was very much caressed by them, being often beckned at under colour of viewing my Habit, which to them seemed very strange.

Here we met with a Bark having about 60 or 70 Men on board, who called to us and prayed us to help them afloat, pretending they were aground, and fast among the sands , which some of our Company would have done , but the major part were for the Negative, and so oversway'd the rest that were willing ; for we saw the Vessel jogg too and again very lightly, that we easily suspected some bad design, as afterward it appeared , for when they saw us wind about, they made all the Sail they could and pursued us, till finding that we were very well armed they gave over their chace.

About evening we put off , and after an hours sailing sounded and found we had 6 fathom- and a sandy ground.

They are Mahometans by profession, but sorry Zealots for their Religion. The Women feed and keep cattel, but their men go out a Robbing. These Mountains are very barren and iandy except where it is chalky. The next day we weighed anchor and came before the Tartarian town Boynak , which when.we had just passed by, it began to blow very hard, from the Sea ward, we having then about 16 fathom Water. In the mean time the Sea began to grow very rough and hollow , that we were forced to run the Shallop immediately a strand for fear of overturningi being then but 5 leagues from Derbent , which was the nearest Land.

However they were very forward to be going, and rejected my Council. In the mean while C. Brak steps with his wife and child at a litle distance from us, and the rest of the Company would that we should leave them there, because that the Woraan and Child were but a cumber to us. So soon as I understood their intent was to leave them so, I insisted on the contrary, with words to this effect.

About half a day we marched with Muskets and other heavy Armor upon our shoulders, besides our baggage, along the sides of the Mountains, till at last we came into a Valley where we were espied by a Company of Troopers, being about 15 or 16. These made up towards us, and drove harder and harder, till coming near at hand, we began to consult about the point of Safety, yet could not come to an unanimous Resolution till it was too late: some were for Defence , others for yielding , which Advice was thought best , and approved on by the major part ; for that we thought if the kind Heavens had given us'the Field for that time, yet we were sure that some must loose their lives, and that they might in the mean time be seconded by another fresh Party, who when all was done would take the remainder and use us the more unkindly for our obstinacy. We therefore upon their approachment freely surrendred our selves Tltyfar- into their hands and implored their Mercy after the best manner, and with all the signs we could.

When they had thus pillaged us, they directed us which way to go for our Safety. Dagestan is a Countrey subject to divers Princes and Lords who are independently Sovereign, but the most principal Provinces are Scemkal and Ofmin , already mentioned: and of those two, the former is the more eminent , the Government whereof is not heredi- \\a strange tary, but by lot, which is after this manner.

Which may also serv for an Embleme to represent Elections in other places, where Policy seems to be more refined. rbey are By that time we had travelled an hour, we were aware of another assailed Troop of Horse, greater than the former, who fell suddenly upon deredl*' us, stripped us to the shirts, and ravished the wife of my Countrey- feeond man Brak, before our Eies, and left her naked.

The marks and pits remain still in my Body, as I have Ihown them to many hundreds since my arrival at home. These Torments I endured with incredible patience, not willing to detect my Countreymen, Torments, I fay, that none without experience could be able to imagine how great. When they insisted hard that I should tell them which way they went, I told them that they went toward the Hilly Countrey, altholwas certain on the contrary for they had determined to go along the River , that they might have their shelter in the Woods. After they had used us so inhumanly and out of hopes of getting any thing from us, they took me and Els Pteterjz ,, tied us legg to legg with a small Iron Chain, and so brought us up to the Prince Ojhnn , often threatening that they would tear us limb from limb, sustaining that Opinion of us that we were of Stephen Radzins Company, and sent out as Emmiflaries on his behalf, and therefore were resolved that his Insistencies should be lay to our charge. When I understood that their Opinion and Intentions were such, I was in a great Consternation , not that I was affraid of Death (for that was what I chiefly longed for, at that time) but that we were liable to such a bad Censure , and could not explain our selves so well, as to satisfy them to the contrary: and besides all that to be kept alive and suffer so many Tortures as they threatnedus, to detect what we were utterly ignorant of, and unable to satisfy them in. When we came to the Princes Palace , they led us thro the Cuards that stood on each side with naked Scimmatars in their handsy these we expected to be our Executioners, to hew us in pieces, altho afterwards we understood it was the manner there, when captives are brought before the Prince.

The City Ur'voaa is mostly inhabited by the poorer sort of Armenians •, but Mount Ararat , by those of the Romish Faith, and other Christians. Mount Ararat is seated just in the parting of Armenia front Media, and is reckoned under the rank of the Dagestan and Caspian Mountains. The Armenians call it Afejsina , and the Per (tans <Afgri : It is much higher than either Caucasus , or the famous Taurus , or any other Mountain in all Medit , Armenia or Perjta , so far as one can view. It is a blew, and dark-coloured Rock. I have found there a kind of a dark yellow Mineral , very ponderous , and sparkling ; but could never learn what mettal it would have produced if melted, nor that of a sparkling Sand and Dust, which I also found here, although I brought a proof of each, which I lost, when we were taken at Sea by the English and plundered, as herafter shall be said at large. This Mountain is for the most part barren, and without Earth , and what may be further said by way of Description, the Reader will find in the Relation of my Ascent towards the T op of it. My Masters purpose was to fell me here, but I could easily perceive, that they had no great mind to buy me. The fame evening two Carmelite Friars came to me, and asked, It I was not a Chi' rurgeon, or, if I had any Judgment that way ?

My Master hearing such a tinkling sum of Money promised, press'd very hard upon me to undertake the Work, promising upon Condition that I effected the Cure, he would declare me Franc.

At every 5 Miles end we found a Hermitage , where we were supplyed with a Peasant and an Ass , to carry our Provision , and Wood for Fewel , because that about the midle of the Mountain it is so extreme cold, that Ice of half a nights freezing, will bear man and horse. In our Journey upwards, we passed through three forts of clouds. The first were thick , misty and dark. The second were cold and like snow , although it was then perfect: summer below in the Valleys , and so warm that the Grapes were very early ripe. The third fort were so cold, that we could hardly endure any longer, and thought verily that we should have grown stiff, and not able to proceed on our Journey. But having now travailed 4 days, and had passed through the highest and coldest clouds , we found the Air very temperate and tolerable. On the 7 of that Moneth , we arrived at the Hermites house, which was hewen out of a Rock, the Weather being there so moderate and gentle as man can imagine , or heart can wislij neither more hot than might very well be endured, nor yet more cold than was expetible and congruous to humane constitution. The fun enlivened us with thwarting beams , which were again refracted, with the refreshing gales of Wind ; the Wind correcting the Sun, the Sun the Wind. The Hermite told me he had lived there 25 years,, and never had seen the weather any otherwise: But on the top of the Hill , it was yet more calm , where as none can remember that the Air there did ever change, or was subject either to Wind or Rain , which is presumed to be the reason that the Ark has endured so long without being rotten. Going into the Hermites Cell, I took a view of the Rupture, which I saw was shut forth about the bulk of a henns-egg; and with one asked him, How long he had had it? he answered', A Moneth: which gave me good encouragement, since I was sure that the Fissure was fresh, and therefore the Cure with greater facility to be effected. Thus I undertook the work, and taking 200 fresh Hen-eggs I boyled them hard, and made thereof an Unguent.

I gave him advice to keep himself a whole year in the Truss, and continue anoynting himself after the manner I did myself, which he also promised to observ. When I took my leav of him, he gave me a piece of hard wood, of a dark-red colour, with a Cross, and a silver Chain which he wore about his neck, as also a Stone, which he told me he had taken from under the Ark; These Relists he adjured me to be very carefull of, saying the real value and esteem thereof would be such, that if ever I came to Rome , and bestowed them on St. Peters Church that they would reward me with a Gift which should serve me for a maintenance so long as I lived. The Wood and the Cross I brought with me, but the stone, with some sparkling Oar were taken from me when the English took our Ship.

The reason why the Baths are there in such esteem , and so much frequented by persons of all Ranks aid Degrees, is not only their affected Cleanliness, in which they surpass all others: but as well thro Superstition: for*that after the use of their Wives , they are to bath, being till then reputed unclean, and may not enter the Mosques: and this both sexes are injoyned to upon such Cafes by the {^Alcoran. A man among them may not ly with his wife from Conception to her Delivery: which is probably instituted as a Precept in the Alchoran to make those Countreys more populous; for so one Man is capable of generating many Children in one year.

The Sultan also promised to write to the King about the Redemption of the rest of the Captiv Slaves , and as much as in him lay to further the fame. Certain it is he did as kindly for our Countrey men as might be expected from him, when as the Brother of the Scemkal came to demand them as Fugitivs , and he refused to let them go , for that they were now in Derbent , and that the King had understood how unkindly ■they had dealt with those that were his Allies, and with those with whom"}, {"page_label": "Seite 295", "page_text": "Chap.

So soon as I understood that P. brents and De Fries were arrived at Derbent I pray'd my Patron to let me go to visit them, which he granted. So soon as I came to them, I begun to enquire of their manner of Escaping, and of their present Condi- dition , which they related from the beginning to the end of all. My Patron was also curious to fee them and came himself in person: Upon which I did bethink my self of a Stratagem to redeem my Companion Els Pieterf ,who was still at Boynak. I told my Master then that I had still a Son in the Hands of Prince Ofmin , and looking towards the Gunner I gave him a wink with the Eie, that he should assert it, which when my Patron asked him he did: he therefore sent to redeem him with intention to keep us both, but the Party sent, who was a Russian and a Renegade, brought us news that he was gone within Land, which sadly troubled me: For, had I got him. to Derbent I could have brought him to Ispahan where there was more apparency and likely hood of obtaining Liberty than among the obscure Tar tars.

Brak was fold by the Scemkd for three years, after the expiration of which time his Patron was to have him again: His Wife whom the Prince had ravished , was also taken from him and made use by the said Prince for a Concubine, being attired in Princely Habit, and had much favour shown her. Brak therefore intending to make his escape, intimated his Design to his Wife j who would by no means assent to the matter, because of her Child , and- told him further that if he did offer to go that she would detect the matter to the Prince. To this he replied, that inasmuch as fire was taken from him they were never like to come together again, and that he probably for that reason should be carried farther within Land , where he should be out of all hopes of ever being redeemed; whereas on the contrary if ever he came to Derbent that there he should not only himself be free, but also seek a mean to get her redeemed , yet all this was but in vain, for she would not hear of it ; insomuch that he was fain to run away without her knowledge; but what then became of him, and whether he was retaken by some others, or is dead, I could never yet be so happy as to know. As to his Flight, we were well assured, for his Patron sent to us at Derbent to enquire after him, but had a very unwelcom Answer : and the Sultan , to hearing that such a Person was come to seek for them, gave order to apprehend him, and so continued him Captiv till he proved that he only came to seek one that he had bought for ready Money, and was not of Intention to meddle with any body else ; upon which the Sultan , ordered him enlargement.

O N the 29 were sent out about 50 Slaves together with some other free persons to hew Wood- in the Countrey , amongst which my Patron sent me also. We took our way c- ver the Mountains, having with us two Carts, with 5 Oxen, 2 Asses and a Horse, we had also several Renegados with us. All. the Company went into the Wood , and fell to work leaving me alone to look to the Carts and Provision. After they had been about z hours at work , I espied a Troop of about zoo Men coming towards us, and thinking by the hast they made towards us, that they were Robbers , I therefore called out to them in the Wood, to give them Notice that they might keep together. When I saw them come within Bow-shot -of me I ran away as fast as I could drive, which they seeing me, sent a Shaft or two, but they did not hit me. Having entred the Wood I met our Company coming out,who at first stoutly resisted, but finding that the Robbers fell on with a greater violence, and-exceeded us both for Arms and Number of Men, they thought good to retreat with as much hast as they could. We left here j 2 dead, a- mongst which was a Polish Renegade; -besides these that were killed we had 20 wounded , and lost all our Baggage , with Carts, Oxen, Asses, &c. and were fain to return so home. For this reason is it very perillous to hew wood or to pass those mountains upon any other Occasion, being the Rendevouz of the Banditti and Tartars , who notwithstanding all the Indeavours which the King doth, by sending of Troops down to expell them, cannot be driven out, for Gg 2 when"}, {"page_label": "Seite 298", "page_text": "Lz6 The Voyages of lobn Strays.

And by reason those of Derhent must have all their Fewel and Timber from this Place, and the work put upon the Slaves, it happens that every year a great number of those miserable sort of men are either dispatched or wounded. The next day I was sent up into the Countrey to a place where my Patron kept his Cattle , which I was to look after and drive The ~4u- them up and down where I found the best Pasturage. When the tbor Sun was gon down and I driving the Cattle to their House, I met 1 5 Robbers , who took three Cows away with them, and tied my away by hands behind my back, so drawing me along > yet it was not long Robbers, before we met with 8 Gentlemen of Derbtnt , som whereof knew me, being frequently at my Masters house. These therefore released me and retook the Beasts, so that I came safe home: for which kindness my Master gave them a Present , I suppose , of more value than what I was fold for to him. Unspeakable was the kindness of my Patron that he had for me, for altho my Work was a litle servile and Slavish, yet my Bed and Table was Lordly > and whatsoever I did whether well or ill, he always took it in good part, and would after that time , never suffer me to go abroad to do any work, saying, that he beleeved that I was born under som malevolent Planet. To be brief I found my daily Task so easy, and my usage so comfortable , that were it not for the name of a Slave and that to a Mahometan, I could not have lived better abroad in any Place of the World, having litle or no care upon my head.

In former times this was a Town of some consideration as to matter of strength; but in the Wars of t _Abas % the Scachy or King of Persta against the Turks , it was by him dismantled and made an open village, which was ever by him a Maxim of Military Policy, by reason the Turks were wont to retire into.fortified Places under pretext of Refuge , and after a few Moneths proving strong and numerous would surrender up the Town to their own Nation in time of War, or upon an Uproar: so that all the Walls toward the scam** South were demolished and only those on the North-fide left flail- ding, which will not much avail upon such sudden Occasions.

The Streets are all thro the Town very narrow and the Buildings low, made up of Clay, Planks and Twigs daubed over. In the South- quarter is a spacious Market-place which they call a Bogan, having roundabout it several rich Shops in Galleries and Piazzas, wherein are seen many rich Merchandizes and Manufactories, as Silks, Cottons, Furrs, Cloth of Gold and Silver, Tapestry, Lee. Near this place are also two great Warehouses having several Portics or Alleys, where all Merchants-strangers buy and fell several sorts of Merchandizes. The one of these is called Scach Canpanfera, or, the Empe- rours Lodgings , whither Rufiims for the most part have recourse, and barter their Tin , Copper , Sables and other Commodities: the other is called Lefgi Carivansera, i. e. The Tartars Lodgings; and hither repair mostly the Dagestan and other Tartars , whose Trade consists chiefly in Men and Children, stole either from their own Nation or the Rustians , as also in Horses: hither also repair many Jews who deal mostly in Bedding and Cottons. This Town upon my arrival there was altogether new built, altho about 3 years before it lay on heaps.

They asked me then, From whence I came? and, if I was a Christian ? I told them that I was a Hollander , They then, if I was a Lutheran ? I said No, but of the true Catholic and Apostolic Church* and with that began to give an account of my Faith as what my Opinion was about the Divine Essence, the Holy Trinity , the Incarnation of our Lord, the Sacred Scriptures, Everlasting Life, &c.

But they had such ample and clear Information at Court of his Life and Behaviour, that they easily perceiv'd upon what account he did it, and consequently declined his Request. Shortly after he also received a Mandate from Ispahan to depart immediatly for/Wa'vff, which Was acceptable news for the Polish Gentry , hoping at once to be rid of that Slavery and Misery they suffered.

Our Captain applies himself to the Chan of Scamachy to intercede for the Cap. tiys, but all he could do might not avail, for there was no Audience lent him, It seemed as if the Sultan of Derbent had hardned his temper, for in presence of the Dutch and others that had taken the Mediation upon them; whereas on the contrary they had ever been good Friends with the Calmuc &cOsmin 3 frequently sending and receiving mutual Presents from each other. When the Captain saw there was no hopes to procure our Redemption at Scamachy , he purposes .to go for Ispahan , and address himself to the King ; the more for that the Commissioners of the Eajl India Company might assist him. He therefore took up several K^dbas of an Armenian , for which he must have pay'd 25 per Cent more at Ispahan : he left I. van Ttrmund at Scamachy for security. On the 18 Christian Brand by the intercession of I. van Termund , was taken to board in the Polish Ambassadors House, giving good security for the same at Scamachy. Mean while the Brother of the said Ambassador went a second time to Court, for to get the consent of the Scach in changing of his Religion , but the result was as unwelcom to him as the former, with an exprels order to depart iinmediatly for Poland , and to give a reason of his delay. This news as it was very unacceptable to him, for that he was sensible how affairs would be represented at WarsaTv, there being a Courier dispatched off from the Scach. to the K. of Poland ; so, was it also very welcom and acceptable news for the oppressed Gentlemen in his Retinue.

However during the time he was at Scamachy , he Lorded it so bravely, that the Chan durst not check him in any extravagancy he committed: for it seems that the said Chan had taken up a considerable Sum of the Ambassador upon Interest and not being able to pay was fain to rest contented. But the Ambassador willing to get in his Money and the Chan not in a Capacity to pay it upon demand, the Ambassador sent his Brother to Ispahan to make complaint to the Schach , which when the Chan had understood , sent a Post after him , who intreated him to return back, upon promise of Payment, and full Solution both of Stock and Interest.

The Merchant was at first surprised, hardly ready enough to give consent that a stranger he had never heard of in his Life should have his only Daughter; and yet durst not well deny him, for those Princes rule with an Arbitrary Power; and alcho gut of some show of Courtesy they seem to request a thing of their Subjects , yet when occasion lervs they command at their discretion: nor dare the Subject either murmure or oppose them in the least, for fear of parting with their sweet Lives, and loss of Estate which is taken from their Posterity.

My Patron professing Christianity was excused from these Expences , holding out, that he being 1 Christian could not safely maintain -Mahometan Superstition.

On the 21 we received a Letter from one of our Company, who was a Slave in Scemkal , altho there was no name set to it, at which we wondred; yet did beleeve it was Anthony Manser the Diamond-cutter. The Contents was r \" That he understood how that there were 2 \"Dutch Chirurgeons at Scamachy , whom-he intreated to redeem \"him, and he would order the Money to be paid at Mofcou. The Letter was delivered to us by order of the Chant but we had not the Power to do any thing for him; yet understood not long after , that the said Manser was carried to Ispahan as Captiv, or Slave. On the 25 we got a Letter from Meyndert Meyndertsz, one of our Company, which was directed to my Patron Bochdan : the Contents thereof being much at one with the former ; yet he gave no other account of his fast Residence, than that he was a Slave and lived not far from Derbent , where being a Smith by his Trade he made Weapons for his Master. He was afterwards bought by a Persan of Zacchu , and since redeemed by I , yan Temmnd.

On the 31 at night we had another great Earthquake, accompanied with fearfull Flashes of Lightning and Thunder : O11 this day was also seen at Scamachy and other places in Persa huge Balls of Fire, which seemed to be hurl'd down from Heaven, with such Force as if the Bands of the World would be dissolved .• this being the most dreadful sight that ever I have seen in my life.

The chut ib had in his hand an t^rabtm Book , out of which he read the Memorials of the Saint with an exceeding loud voice; which ended he was silent for a little while, and then again began all the Priests to sing with a strange melody orrather howling, for it was but a confused Harmony,ever crying out 0 Hojfeyn! 0 Hojfeyn! Hojfeyn! In ssiort a third part of what I heard was Hcjs'eyn. After these followed all the Great Personages; and next to them z Great Pageants of form, square, each with a pompous Canopy, these were suppor* ted and born by a certain number of Men, on the one was the Representation of the Prophet being signified by a Person who had taken in a Potion which made him to steep for 48 hours fogethcr, lying upon a Bier. Round about the [supposed] Corps fate 6 little Boys, who had the Art of weeping ad unguent. Above the Canopy stood two Towers very pompous and costly, and out of the one a Youth put forth his Head weeping aloud and dolefully cried out Hofieyn , Hojfeyn! 0 Hofieyn , hojfeyn!

This was mainly occasioned upon the request of his unnatural ind merciless F ather, who was an eminent Gentleman, and Inhabitant of Scam Achy.

The Hail a \" dHil did much damage to the Fruit, every Hailstone being of an unusual bigness, som as large as the Egg of a Hen or Turky. On the 6- of June I went with a Venetian (who had bin a-Slave in Turky and run away) about 15 Miles within Land, where we found an Armerwn Friary. The Monastics received and treated us very kindly , when they understood that we were Christians , and in Slavery to the CMahomeuns. They intreated us to tell them all the passages we had met with abroad, which the PenetianSrii did, arid afterwards desiring me to do .the like, I. related all in brief, which they took great delight to hear , especiallyabout the taking in of Ashachan. They desired us further to tarry with them'for som time,which we promised to do^ and accordingly stay'd there two nights. All the time they caressed us with all kindness imaginable , neither sparing for Victuals nor good Drink: profeiling thensselvs sorry that-our condition would not allow them the happiness of a longer enjoyment of our Company. Their manner of ■ Life was very single, without any Incumbrance of th e. . Mahometans ,, their Hous-holding regular and' gentile-, and the-Men among thensselvs mutually loving one another , and sociable with strangers , very charitable to alb that were in necessity, of what Opinion or F aith soever they were. R.ightrloath we were to leav- them, but not daring to stay any longer, we took our leav-s of them-, thanking them for their kindness and civility they had shown us. In taking our way to Scamachy , we were fain to climb over some Hills, and one great Mountain flat at Top, upon which was a Lake, according to our guessing, 3 miles in Circuit.Goingalong the shore to our great amazement we foundfour Bodies of Men that had but newly been murthered, having their throats' cut, ' we supposed them to be Anglers, seeing Fishing Canes and other Implements about them. However, we thinking it for two reasons unsafe for us to.stay there any longer, made all the hast we could to get out LI 3 of"}, {"page_label": "Seite 338", "page_text": "V zyo The V oyages of Iokn Struyr.

This Lake as we afterwards understood was very plen- 1671. tifull of many kinds of delicate Fish, which are fold very dear and highly esteemed of abroad throughout all that part of the Countrey, and indeed it was once our thoughts to make a Trial if we could take any thing, till meeting with these new murthered Persons , we chused rather to let the Filh remain in their Element, than by the probable consequence to pay too great a price for our sport. On the 9 happened a very Tragical passage at Scamachy, which, notwithstanding the horrible spectacle I had seen the Day before, made my Heart beat withrn my Breast, as it did many times after that, when it came into my mind. A Polish Woman and a Slave was taken by a Perjian for his Wife. Whether Hie had som private Quarrel with him, or that she was conscious of som misbehaviour to him I cannot determine, however she came to my Patron the Polish Ambassador, first making a large Demonstration of her State, and of her Friends and Family in Poland , she requested that my Lord would vouchsafe her his Protection, till such time as she could meet with an opportunity to convey her self clandestinly home into her own Countrey. My Lord , at the earnest intreaty of som Domestics who were his Minions, assented: but after she had so privily held her self about the space of 14, days, her Husband got Intelligence by som Pick-thank or other, where she was, applies himself immediatly to Court, where (after a litle soliciting) he gets an Order to fetch her out, and use her as seemed good to him. But considering that the Domestics of my Lord were too numerous and a little unruly, he durst not attempt to make the demand, but went back again to Court desiring Aisi- stancc upon which the Prince sent som of his, Officers , who when our People saw that they were com in a warrantable way, durst not oppose them, nor had they any conveniency to put her out of the way, so that she was forthwith delivered into the hand of her Husband. The Man having as was said permission to punish her at his own Discretion had already provided a Wooden Cross , upon which, with the help of his Servants, he bound her fast, being mother naked, and with his own hands flea'd her whilst yet living. I stood my self all the while at the Door with a great Company of Men, Women and Children , and heard her cry out most bitterly.

Thisjealousyistherea- son that few who covet a good name and would be reputed honest go with any part of their bodies uncovered, save only their Eies, their Face being muffled up in Silks or Cotton. Those who go with uncovered Heads, are such as we commonly call Gamesters, and prostitute. So soon as any one comes in a doors, the Woman runs into a Chamber and locks her self up that she may not be seen, althothe Slaves have often the Opportunity to violate their Masters Couch notwithstanding all the Indeavours they use to suppress them. But Emuths, the King and the Great ones of the Realm prevent that by gelding their Slaves 5 which they doe very effectually, but Modesty forbids me to make further mention of the Manner. They do it commonly when they are youngbuying Children that are stollen from their Parents , and are therefore in regard of their bringing up, held in greater value than others , as also because that there is hardly one in three that both live and like. The price which is set upon them. is one reason why ordinary Persons have them not, and another is because that if they thrive they grow very fat and lazy, and consequently unfit to do any service they have occasion for. And by reason that Womeri-Slaves are.somewhat rare among them , the Merchants and Citizens Wives are mostly attended by Men, who if they have a sprightly and airy way and Carriage, aresomtimesadmitted to enjoy those illicit Pleasures, which in process of tune they recom- pence with the loss of their Lives.

This she said with a smiling Countenance, which cured me of the Palsie, that the sight of her had already struck me into.

On the 1 I th ' of Inly is a great Fair at Scamachy, upon which day above 500 Slaves were brought to Market, that being their main Traffic. Of these Slaves are of all sorts of People , Men , Women , Children , Christians and Pagans , Polomans , -Russians , Georgians and Circas-Tartars. The Poles &c Ruffes are commonly stole by the Dageflan- rartarsy as also the Circajfes which are Heathens, for according to the Voice of the \\yilcbwan no Mahometan [or Mufulmatf -may be made a Slave , which mainly tends to the Propagation of Tttrcifm. On.the contrary the Circas-Tarurs in revenge do steal the Dagestans and fell them to the Russians. And so the Tartars , altho seemingly many Nations , yet doubtless of old one People , live in constant jarrs and private .Hostility, who if they had but Discretion and Conduct answerable to their Power, werem acapacky to subdue both Rtfs -and Persia. But as for the Georgians <1 hey are generally such as are sold by their own inhuman Parents, and m that out do both 7 #r£and'Pagan who wili not makefile, of such as are oftheir own Opinion or Nation , much less their own Children , which is a thing so besides Nature, that the most savage Beasts do abhor it, and will as soon part with their Life as with their Young.

About 2 hours alter fell down 6 more, which were as big as Hogs-heads , these consumed and wasted a great part of the ground where they light.

The next day fell abundance of Rain, that all the whole Face of the Oountrey round about Scamachy lay under Water, and the streams coming from the Mountains brought down huge Pieces of Rocks and Stones which came down into the Town and carried away several Houses with them, as also many People who were on every side environed with the Floods that they could not help themselves. This Tempest concluded with fearful Thunder-claps and Lightning, as if the last day were com. On the 17 the Chan had a Robe of Favour sent him from the King.

On the j 8 of August we had a great Earth-quake which raged a long time together, 111 which many Dwelling Houses, Stables and Barns without the Walls on the Eaffside of the Town were thrown down, and abundance of Men crush'd to pieces. When the Earthquake was past, it began to rain very hard, and blew extremely. The S uj>irsti. lame day I had occasion to go without the Walls where walking a mnos litle towards the Fields I saw about 100 Benkns performing Sacri- flees to the Fowls and Fish. They lay upon their knees and strowed Rice and Beans upon the Land and in the River. These Indians will never kill any living Creature, not so much as Lice, whichaltho they take yet set them down in som place or other to pasture, and let them shift for themselvs. When they see any Person go out a Bird- ing with a Fowling-piece, Ginns, or other Implements they will give him Money to go home again ; or , if they perceiv any one about to shoot they will be sure to spoil his Game, by chacing away the Fowl , insomuch , that if the Party be a Choleric man, they are in danger of their Lives. The like they doe with the Fish, when they fee any com to Angle, and trouble the water. When they are about to make water , or cafe themfelvs they alwaies look about them if there be no Vermin or any thing that hath life upon the Ground, which if there be, they remove it away very carefully, lest they should do it harm. During the time ot these Festival Days, which happens 8 times a year, they will burn np Candle, Tapour, or Torch; lest Muskettos, and other Insects that sty about the Flame should singe their Wings. They have also offered the cbm a considerable sum of Money that no Beast should be stain during the time of these Feasts, but the Chan would not listen to any such thing. These people are also very superstitious in many other things, and withall strict: and zealous. They will not use either Disti or any other Vessel belonging to such as are not of their ow n Sect , yet will suffer others, to make use of theirs. They abstain from Flesh, and Fish, and whatsoever had, or may have life, insomuch that they are as shy of an 'Egg as of the Bird that lays it.

At-this place is a long Bridgemade of Keels, and thwarted with massy Planks .that are fastned together with great Bolts and Chains, which for better security is guarded with a good number of Soldiery.

On the 4'h- duo , we set forward, and in the way found the River Bdt ham, which for Greatness gives place to all the before named > Tortoises but, for the.Multitudes of Tortoises that are taken here about, no less famous nor inferiour to any other in all the surface of the Countrey. t [,ani. All along the Banks we saw holesand caves which those Animals had made in the Sand , the fhoar appearing like a Coney-borrough. These Caves have their mouth or entrance al waies to the Southward, where they lay their Eggs. On the Countrey through which this River softly glides we saw several Cottages or Tents, as we did the day before, but found the Inhabitants harmless and very poor, yet merry and jocund, the Children were stark naked,and the Men and Wo- . man had hardly cloaths enough to cover their middle. They received us in very friendly manner according to their ability, bringing us Milk for our felvs, and Provender for the Camels and Horses, which they fold as a very mean and inconsiderable Price , considering under what necessity we were then.

However, I would not be so far misconstr'd, as to signify that there is no sensible difference between the Summer and Winter, for the Course of the Sun makes a noted alteration, and yet the Summer Colds seemingly more penetrating than those in the Winter, for Now the Body is shut, and T hen it is open, at what time they hold it more dangerous, but in the Ap- proachmentofthe Winter more tolerable and better to be endured.

But the next morning finding him in a pleasant humor I renewed my request and he assented, tho conditionally , as, First, to keep silence all the time, since I was not perfect in the Dialect:, and so might com to be discovered ; Secondly , not to stare any Person fully in the Face ; and Thirdly , to act: for Changeling in case any Body came to question me, Fools and Madmen being with them reputed Holies, for they are of Opinion that all men have an equal understanding, and that those, who are either MadorFoo- \" lish imploy the rest of their Senses in a Divine and Celestial Contemplation , or Converse with Angels. ^#De- The Grave or Tomb stood in the midst of a spacious Court, and hfs L l * on built round j above all was a round Tower, which was covered with Blew and Green Stone glazed, which made a most gorgeous show.

Above the Tomb under a Canopy of Blew Silk hung4, Lamps, 2 of Gold, and 2 of Silver, which every night are lighted by certain Attendants which they call Turachtjchikan. When my Patron approached to the Grave the Waiters took off the Covering, which was of green Vcivet, upon which after he had mumpled over certain Prayers bowed himself, puihed with his head against the Tomb, kissed it, and so stepping backwards, was met at the door by one of the Hafisms who gave him the Benediction , and so dismissed him.

After this we went thro another Gate far more beautifull than the reformer , and within this was a fair Garden, and indeed one of the fairest: I had hitherto seen; It was planted with all manner of Flowers-and Herbs that might delight the Eie and Nose, and all kinds of delicious Fruits to serve the Palat. Every Man has his freedom to walk and recreate himself, but upon a very strict: penalty not to pluck either Flower or Fruit. I was told how that 5 years before my being there, a drunken Perfirn had hewn down a great bough with his Scymiter , but being taken was immediatly beheaded with the same Weapon. In this Gate hung also another great Silver Chain, which was given by the Chm of Kent&ay. Here they demanded our Weapons , which being delivered, my Patron went forward to another Gate, which entring he fell down and kissed the. Threshold, withall charging me not to touch it with my Feet, lest I should pollute that which many thought worthy a long Pilgrimage to Com and kiss: he told me also that it was a favour greater than ordinary , that I being a blind ignorant Christian and an Infidel should be admitted to pry into so glorious a Sanctuary. I was heartily content to obey his Will, rather than to deny my Curiosity, and followed him close at the Heels, lest coming into som Labrynth I should loose my Life by the Loss of my Master. The next Place we came into was a stately Gallery > or rather an Antichamber, arched cross wife, and neatly plaistered. On the right hand as I went in was a great Silver Cock which ran with Water that was conveyed thither by leaden Pipes from a fair Fountain about 4 [ Englijh ] miles without Town. Right over against this is another Apartment paved with green and blew glazed stones: and on the Floor was spread a very rich Carpet: in the middle stood two huge Silver Candlesticks about 8 or 9 Foot high; round about were Seats as in our Chores, wherein fat several Priests all in white Stoles, who sung all the time, keeping good Harmony, and at the End of every Verlicle bowed all alike, one to another. This Place is called T&iehillachane , the Chappel or Oratory of the King; so called by reason of the 4,0 days, which the P-erfims affirm that Scacb Sepby spent here at one time, in Fasting andPrayer, not using any thing all that time, save only a Cup of Water once a day.

The Parlour, or Hall into which we now came was all paved and laid in with a splecked Stone; The Building its self was round , like a Theatre ; the Doors were laid over with Silver Plates and had two great Silver Rings like Wreaths, or Torses. At the Entrance lay a costly and large Carpet, where we were to pull off our Boots, without which, none is admitted to go in, no not the King himself, who somtimes to be a Precedent and Example of Zeal, pulls off his Boots at the first Gate, but that, it seems, is held to be a Work of Supererogation. From hence we went to another Magnificent Hall, thro a Gallery, the Pavement whereof was covered with rich Tapestry. The Doors of this said Hall were covered with Plates of Gold, which was don at the Charges of the Schach *^ 4 bas , who had made a vow to do it, in cafe he returned home with Triumph, when he went on an Expedition against the Usbeques in Chorafan, as he did, and vanquished the Rebels. This Hall is not so spacious as beautifull by far, the Roof being no more than 48 Foot ■ long,and 30 broad. In the middle hung several Gold and SilverLamps, and on each side fate 12 Priests, each having a low Stool before him, on which lay so many Parchment Books, containing several Legends of the ^Ichor an , which they read and fung by Turns. Leaving this Place we went into another which was separated and environed with Silver Rails, and had 3 Ascents or Steps to go up of solid Silver. This is the last and chief Oratory, or House of Prayer, where our Patron pray'd with very great Zeal. From hence we ascended into another Place, which was one Step higher, and separated with massy Grate-work all of pure Gold and wreathed , behind this was the Tomb of Schach Sephj , which was of fair Marble, being about 3 Foot high, 9 Foot long and 4 broad. It was covered with a Carpet ot Crimson Velvet , richly embroidered and laid in with precious Stones. Above hung several Lamps, and on each side 2 huge Candlesticks., all of solid Gold: these are lighted every Evening and burn all the Night long. The Door of'this Place is opened for no Secular or Temporal Person or Personage, nor for the King himself. Near this Tomb we saw also the Tombs of Schach Ifmael , of Sephjs, and of som Queens, all which were only supplyed with Curtains , and void of curious Work and Ornament.

Arabic and Syrian Tongues , the Books were piled up one above another and molt of them adorned with Gold and Silver * whence I concluded that they were more for show , than for dayly use and recourse. In this said Library were several less Appartments, where were many Porceline Dishes, Cups and other Utensils, for the Kitchin and Table, which are used when the King or any other great Personage comes to Eat there, whereas they fay it is not consistent with the Humility they profess, to be served in Gold or Silver: the more because that the great SchachSephy himself did eat altogether out of Wooden Dishes. From hence we went out and came into the Kitchin, the Doors whereof were covered with Silver Leavs by the aforesaid Schach ^Abas , and the Room within very neat and handsom. The Cooks were all the time very still and quiet, as if it were som Religious Duty they were about, and each one according to his Office had a place allotted him, to wit, those that roasted and those that boiled, baked, fried, stewed, &c. each by themselvs. The Cauldrons were set fast in the Walls , and the Water they used was brought som Miles by an Aqueduct, and let in by Silver Cocks. In this Kitchin is provided Victuals for more than a Thousand People, one day with another, to wit, Priests, Pilgrims, and other Poor People which have here their Maintenance. They eat three times a day, at 6 in the Morning, at io before, and 3 in the afternoon. The two first Meals were given by Schach Sephy y and the last at the Charges of the present King. Before the Meals do begin, they beat 2 Kettle-drums, which they fay their great Prophet Mahomet made use of when he was in the Camp , and were brought from iMedim by Schach Sedredin. They have not much variety in their Diet, and use mostly Rice and Mutton, which is distributed very liberally to all the Appendents, who seldom com short but leavof their Commons.

By the way we met several Troops of 16721 Robbers, who probably had understood what a Prey and Purchase we had, yet finding the Lar ay an so very numerous durst not assail us. At night we came to Sengoa a beautiful! Village, where we had very good Wine, and made our selvs merry, but not to excess, for that is in general odious to the Persians. Here I saw the best Beauties and most comly Paces that I have seen in all Persia: their Women seem to have a greater Liberty than in most places, where they do not only go covered abroad, but are also denied the converse with Men j for here they go bare with their Face, and are very familiar with those of the Masculine Gender, and if I be not mistaken were too familiar with some, who within a few daies after began to scratch their Heads, and this is the first time I knew that the Persian Women understood French. In sum , our Company enjoy'd themselvs here so contentedly and well, that somof'em thought the Sun had mistaken himlelf and was risen an hour too soon. The day following leaving Sengoa, we had high and rocky way, but towards the Evening came- into a most sweet and pleasant Dale or Plain, through which a River glided very swiftly. This Valley was very pleasant, and not withstanding the season, appeared as if it were in May. This River is called Kifilofeyn , having a very fair Stone Bridge over it, over which we passed and pitched on the South side, in the open Field, for there were no Houses to be seen. On the 28 th - we broke up and went over the famous Taurus , being a very rough and dangerous way, insomuch that all the Company were fain to allight and lead their Camels and Horses, till we came into a Valley where we took our Rest for an Hour, or two. This Valley is very deep and a Nest of Robbers and Vagabonds, who find many lurking Places to hide themselvs in, out of which they assail and surprise Travailers, if they think themselvs strong enough: but we , as was said before, being increased to a considerable Number knew our selvs sufficiently out of peril. Out of this Valley arifeth the River Ktsilofyn , which running very swiftly and beating thorow the Rocks makes a very hideous Murmur, so that one cannot hear another speak: thus receiving as it were inlargemcnt runs through the Champain Countrey of Kdm, and thence is hurried with an ad- P p 2 mirable"}, {"page_label": "Seite 371", "page_text": "nor. i &7 it 300 The Voyages of lobnStruys. Vm.III, mirable celerity into the Caspian Lake, into which it empties it self. On the Banks of this River is a Village bearing the fame name, where is a fair Stone Bridge of 9 Arches, or Bows. All along the Wayside grow great plenty of Almond, Cypress and other Trees, which served us all the way in stead of Parasols: but when we were come over the River found the Way very bad, being forced to clamber over Rocks, the Path being so narrow that only one Camel at once could go on it. On each side were many great Clefts and deep Caves , which with the rattling of the Horses feet made a dreadfull and horrid Eccho ; and being come to a place which was the fullest of those Caverns, all the Company gave a Shout, which with an Eccho resounded from one Place to another, that it seemed as if there had been 10 or 12 Troops of Men in so many several Places calling to one another. On this way it happened that a Camel broke the Leathers wherewith his Pack was fastened to the Crutchet or Saddle, being just at the Brink of a wide and deep Pit, where no Bottom could be seen. It cost the Slaves who attended him much labour to save him, and were in struggling once in great hazard themfelvs of tumbling down, Camel and all, yet at last, with loss of the Pack which in. spite of all they could do fell down, they got clear. The Pack was very rich, and the loss thereof fo concerning to the Merchant, that if others had not kindred him he had thrown the Slayes after it, for their Negligence. This ill way much detarded us on this Days Journey, for we were more than 5 Hours in travailing one Mile. Being got over this bad way we found a Village where it was designed that we should take our nights rest ■, The name of the Town was LtMLt, being very poor and not in a Condition to supply us with such Necessaries as we desired for our Money. On the 2 9 we broke up, and had that day very good way, coming at night to the village Horizimur , where we were very ill at ease being cold W earlier and the Place not able to supply us with House-room. The next day leaving Hort&mur we travailed thro a very dry and barren Heath, meeting by the way with fom Robbers, who being but few in number durst not make any attempt upon us: However night coming upon us here, we were fain to set down on the Heath, and for fear of Robbers forced to watch all night, but were so be- nummed with cold that we many times wished for break of day.

Melons , divers forts of huge Grapes and many other Fruits then out of season. Veal and Mutton was here very cheap, as also Bread. Thus finding Provision here very cheap, we bought what we thought necessary. As for the City it self there is not much worthy of Remark about it, save onely a very fair and beautifull c Metzdd. It is situated in a Plain, and a flat Ground, but near the Town very barren and dry. It has been formerly a great Emporium, and flourished more than 4, Centuries of years in T raffic and Commerce with the circumjacent Countreys, but since it was demolished by the great TamerUn , is so run to decay, that it is out of Hopes, ever to arrive toit'spristin State. On the 2 of Decemh. we set forward and came in good time to Sul- tanie , a City lying in 36 degr. and 30 min. Northerly Latitude. It is situated between two rows of very steep Mountains , and toward the West we saw the Mountain Keydar re)amber , whose lofty top seems to support the Heavens, this being, next to Ararat , the highest Mountain I have ever seen. The City Sultanj affoards a most noble Prospect: from abroad, by reason of her many lofty Piles, magnificent Churches, high Towers, Pyramids, Obelisks and Cylinders which still, remain, notwithstanding the furious Irruption of the savage Tartars, under conduct: of the valiant Tamer lan ,. who with many other T owns , laid this level with the Ground, lave the great and stupendious Fabrics, even now remembred, which when one is within Town, Iookjike asetofNine-pins, or the Stones on Salisbury Plain: so that this which was reputed one of the Royal Cities is meaner than most villages. It was built by Sultan choddabende a very rich and potent Prince , who besides many famous Conquests in rerfia and UJbec , subdued the greatest part of Turky , and many Indian Kingdoms and Provinces , som of which still remain under the subjection of the Schach of Persia. This City he called Suit ante from the * Honorary *^ s c$ Title of Sultan, for so the Kings of Perjia who are now called Schach sarca were of old entitled, as also at present the ottoman Emperour.

This was fortified on each side with strong Walls and several great Bulwarks, altogether built ot huge square Stones of z Foot Diameter ; it had also 4 high Towers , but strong and of neat Workmanship. Within is a very noble Sepulchre built by Sultan Choddabertic himself: who lay here interred, but the too great Piety of his Succesiorwould not suffer his Bones to rest, but removed them to the UMesihaichat i^/frdebil. In entring this Sepulchre one must pass thro three very high Gates all made of Indian Steel, very neatly polished, and as smooth as Glass , this being the fame Mettal of which the Damafkm , or Ar de- bil Scymiters are made , and is preferred before any other Steel that is used. That Gate which leads out to the May dan (as the Persians would perswade themselvs and us) cannot be opened by any Force,but when one prays to GOD, for the fake of his Servant exf/y, that it may open, it opens of it's self. The Building is very high, contracting its self at top into the manner of a Tower* and within is set with white and blew Tiles ofPorccline. Above, where it begins to draw its self into the form of a Tower, is a Partition of Steel Barrs, which makes a handsom Chore. In this Partition or Quire I saw many Books,written in Arabic Characters, some whereof were above zo Inches long, I opened one of them and found an interlineary change of Gold and Black lines, like the Rubrics in the Romas* Breviaries, Liturgies and Mass books. Behind the Altar is the Tomb where Sultan CMuhamed Choddabende lay interred but parted from the Body of the Chore with great and massy Barrs of Indian Steel, which the Persians fay was all of one piece, no place appearing where it might seem to be well'd, or set together, and that it was. seven years a making in India. In this said Emarath are 20 pieces of Brass Ordnance, every, Carridge having 4 wheels a piece, and the Balls lying by them of white Marble, these are made (forsooth) for defence of theH. Sepulchre. The Tower above is 8 square, and on each side a Gallery, and upon each Gallery a small Turret going up with Winding-stairs. Before this Temple is a Fountain, the curious Work whereof shows the great skill and dexterity of the Workman that ordained it: it receives its Water by an Aqueduct from the Keydar: and behind the Emarath is a very pleasant Garden, with Walks and Rows of divers forts of Trees.

The People conformable to the place they inhabit gave us great Satisfaction, and were very sociable and friend! y to converse withall. On the Ninth we set forward again , and came at night to tire f . ' City Cafivin , which is a Town of no small repute. It is situated in 36 degr. 15 mm. Northerly Latitude, lying in the Countrey oi'Erak, aipon a level, but dry and sandy ground, having on the West the Mountains of Ehvind which reach as far as Babylon , or Bagdei , as it is now called. This City is about 6 English Wilts m circuit, and has bin formerly the Residence of the King and Court of Perfia : but since the same was translated to Ispahan , it has continually run to decay , and dayly looses it's glory. The Walls and Fortifications which seem to have bin very strong, lie buried in their Rubbish and unrepaired , for that this City lies far within the Persian Dominions and dreads not any sudden Irruption as those that lie on the Confines are ever fearfull of, and therefore either without any Fortifications at all, to the end they may not prove a Check, if once invested and taken in by the Enemy , or else so strongly munited that they may resist a durable Siege : and another reason why the City Cafmn fears no Forreign Invasion is the Strength of the Inhabitants , who are so numerous that upon occasion they can make up a mighty Army. The Houses are, as most other Towns in Persia , mostly built of Brick which is only hardned in the Sun: so that without they appear with no Statelyness or Magnisicency, but within neatly painted with Compartments and Foliage. The Streets are not paved as in other Places, so that when it is windy they are not passable, for the Dust that sties about, which besides the aptness it has to hurt ones Eies, is no small annoyance to those who areapparreled in a gay Garb.

And on the outlide round about plealant Walks of Cedars and Cypress trees. In this City are 2 May dans. On the one stands a Magnificent Hall, full of Shops, wherein are to be fold Jewels and many other things of value. Near this Exchange t be ex- is a place where they deal altogether in Living Jewels , which are there to be had at as mean a Price as a Lurcher or Shock upon the \". Dog-market at K^dmstcrdam\\ these being such Jewels as we commonly call Girls of the Game, Misses, or Cracks, and I know not what canting names they have now a days for such unnatural and sensual Prostitutes: The ter funs call them Cabbaha. About Sun-set these are all brought out and set in a row by an old Woman they call Held who estimates as a Broker. Behind these young Females stand a parcel of old W omen who have by them a Bolster, a Quilt; a Coverlet, and a litle Lanthern in the Hand, all Implements for the purpose. 'Now so soon as any one corns to view the Merchandise, these old Punks light the Candle , unyail the Face, and so going from one to another till he finds one he likes and then strikes a Bargain; which done one of the old Women follows him with the Moveables on her Shoulder whithersoever he pleases, and all with as litle stiame- lastness as if it were the most honourable Merchandise in the World. On the East fide of the City is the Common place of Sepulture: where also lies interred the Body of Sehach Befade , the Son of Hojfeyn.

Wherefore they alwaies lead a Camel thro the streets for 3 dates together before this Feast, adorning it with Garlands of Leavs and Flowers, if there be any to be had, and on the Festival stay it, with many Ceremonies. First comes the Mulla , who is one Ikill'din the Law , and reads certain Passages out of the ^Alchoran, when he is silent they play upon Trumpets, Flutes and Drums. In the mean while the Common-People run and crowd in to the Camel 3 to get fom of the Hair , every one pulling as much as he can , which is kept for Relicts , and reputed good for Women in Childbed who cannot easily be delivered ; insomuch that the Beast is almost bare before he com to be Offered. When they have led him 3 days about Town he is brought out of the City to a place thereto appointed, where all the greatest Personages are present and immediately make a Ring. The Beast being brought in, one of the most eminent Persons runs him thro with a Spear ,' upon which all the People run with Hatchets, Bills, and Knives striving every one to get a piece, which they carry home, fom boyling it, anjl others preserving it till the year after, reckoning it a certain and lure token of Happiness to that House, where there is but a fmal Morsel of this Camel. Those who are stow or impotent must be content with the Entrails, Skin, and Blood which they gather up so clean, that nothing of it appears upon the Place where the Sacrifice is done.

On the 19 we betook our felvs to our Journey, and that day travailed about 24 \\_E\"ghfh~\\ Miles, over a high, but level Way,homing towards night to the great Caraioanser* called Choskem.

On the Southeast side of the Town grows abundance of Tobacco, but not cultivated or planted, which is no small profit to the Inhabitants. On the 24, we departed from Saba , and at night set down at the Cara^panfera Schach Per abath. It was now good travailing by reason of the Cold which in this hot Climate is very acceptable, being not; far from the Torrid Zone* where in the Summer time besides the scorching heat of the Sun, the Ground is so hot that it brings all the Skin off ones Feet, the ways being altogether dry and sandy, which also casts a reflection of the Sunupon ones Face, as if it came out of a Furnace , whence many arestifled with the Heat. On the 25 we came to the City Khom , and took up our Lodging in a Caraivansera near to the great May dan. This seems to be a City of an ancient standing, and is at present very large, hut by the Ruins of a Wall a considerable distance from the Town it appears that it has bin anciently much larger than now it is. It lies in ^^degr. 17 mi\"\" Northerly Latitude , and is situate on a level flat Ground having on the right hand the Mountains of Elivend whence issue two Rivers which run thro this City , first uniting themselvs a litle above the Town. In, the Winter they lay a Bridge over it, but in the Summer it is some times dry. Near this Bridge stands a litle Chappel, wherein they fay the Sister of one Iman Rtsa , who was one of the most eminent Successors of Mahomet lies interred.Th tPersians have also a special veneration for this Female Saint, and make long Pilgrimages to kiss her Tomb. However the City Khom has many fair and spacious Streets, with many Piazzas and Galleries, to defend from Sun and Rain. They Have also great plenty of Fruit, as at Saba , as also Cotton and Tobacco, which grows here in no less plenty than at Saba aforesaid. Besides the many rare Fruits and Plants they have, there is an excellent fort of Melons, having the outward form and colour of an Orange, and is oftentimes taken for one., but being cut up appears within as another Melon.

They have also the common sort of Melons which we commonly call Musk-millions, that far surpass ours for Delicacy. Khom is a place very considerable in regard of Traffic this being eminent for Swords, Knives, Armorers and Cutlers Works. Some of our Company bought here Scymiter Blades, for which they paid to the value of 20 Crowns apiece, yet were not those of the best sort. The Steel they have from Niris near ifpah.m where are several Mines. Besides the Smiths work their chief Manufactory is Potts, there being many Fullers, who are efleemed the belt in Perfia and their work preferred before Porceline, which is transmitted all over the Countrey. The Inhabitants are sociable and friendly enough to converse withall when you have not much to loose, but we were warned to look well about us, for they say that they are brought into the World with their Fist doubled. My Patron loft here 2 new Scymiters he had lately bought , and I a Tobacco box. Six days long stay'd the Caravan here, during which time there was much Merchandise negotiated. Here I was cruelly pestered with a Greek Renegado , who continually rail'd upon me , crying , Ton faithless Dog , you Infidel , &c. The Fellow had so often affronted me with these and the like Words that I was no longer able to endure him, but finding an opportunity I grasp'd him by the Collar, and trounc'cLhim lustily off with my Fist, and at last getting him down I pummeld him back and sides, saying, Ton y ar let , noh> yon Jhall find the Fiji of a Man , and not the Palo of a Dog.

On the other side of the Town are several Royal Gardens and Summer Houses, and amongst the rest one of a stately Fabric, having a Thousand Windows. Kaschatt is at this day the most populous and eminent Marts in all Persia ; having also a very famous Basar and Maj Am with Piazzas and stately Galleries , wherein are many rich Shops. It is the staple for the most part of the Silk stuffs that are made in Persia. They have also many that work in Velvets and Sattins but not altogether so good as those in Europe j so that the King has sent often to Venue exprefly for Workmen to come and reside there, which nevertheless he cannot accomplish. The CaraMnanjeras which are here very numerous do surpass all others that ever I have seen elsewhere: that where we took up our Quarters being more like a Palace than an Inn as I have said before, having 65 spacious Rooms, besides many Conveniences which others want.

Hither resort many Indian and other Merchants, coming very far and bringing with them many rich Wares and precious Commodities. There are abundance of Looms for Cloth of Gold and Silver , as also many that make Tapestry , and no less is the numb r of Idle Persons, who swarm hither from all Parts, and like Drones are maintained by the sedulous Labours of those that take Pains, and here have I seen more Beggars than ever I have seen in any Town in all my Travels.

Yet still continued this Frenzy with him, till he died, only som say that by certain Expressions he made, about the Eternity of the Soul, he was sensible of himself a little before his Death. He was bur ed with a more than ordinary Pomp, considering the meanness of his Person, as to outward Estate; but was highly set by for his perseverance and constancy in the Christian Faith. His outward Qualities were very commendable being of a handsom stature, fair Complexion and in every Way and Gesture very taking: nor was he less to be praised for the internal Faculties of the Mind and Soul, being very conscientious and just in all his dealings, and withall pious.

It was appointed at the Intercession of the vst-ec Ambassador by the King who was himself present, and was mounted on a stately x^irabi&n Horse richly capparilon'd, for the Sadie and Saddle-cloth were very richly embroydered and id thick beset with Rubies and other Precious Stones that one could hardly view it. The Court and ■Royal Retinue were also well mounted and appeared very splendid. When they were ready to try their Dexterity one went up to the Top, * and set up a Cup of Gold, which who could hit and bring it down, should not only have it for his Pains, but also be preferred to great Honour , and take place among the Princess of Persia. The King gave the Tartars the Advantage of shooting first who after they had shot more than an hour, were fain to give over: for it was to be don on Horseback, and the Horse in a fullcarier, and furthermore not to shoot till they came to a certain Place where they had the mast directly on the leftside. The Ambassador seeing that none of his men Were so dexterous gave over, and desired the King that he would vouchsafe, to try the skill of the Perjtans. Upon which the King ordered certain Persons, who, without doubt, were very expert Marksmen, to ride in a circle, one for one, where the third that shot had the Fortune to bring it down, upon which the Perjtans gave a shout that the Palace rang again. Upon this he was sent for by the King and brought into the Palace with as much Triumph as if he had won fom signal Victory > the Cup , Bow, and Quivers were like Tro- phys carried before him , by certain Heraulds thereto appointed, and he himself altho but a poor Mans Son of KejUn . promoted to great honour and reckoned in the Degree of a chm.

The Gate which enters the Mefqmte is of fair Marble and about as high as that of the Mefchaich of chiddabende in Suit ame. The Doors of this Temple are laid ore with Silver Plates, and set in with Flowers of Gold. Entring within the Gate, you com into a pompous Antichamber, the Floor whereof is befpred with very fine Marts, upon which they fall down on their Knees, and make a short prayer. From hence on each hand is a stately Gallery , each leading into another spacious Court, having in the middle a great Fountain, with a Bath. Above these great Galleries are som less, which are supported by marble Pillars, the Chapters and Foliage whereof are neatly gilded. When you are past these Galleries and the Courts , you come into the Temple it self, entring in at a splendid Port, withinand under the deling, all laid in with blew Tiles of true Porceline, and intermixed with Flowers of Gold. The Temple its self is very large and sumptuous, supported with huge marble Pillars. On the right hand at going out of this Church, you enter thro an Arch into a magnificent Hall, where stands a Pulpit and an Altar, which said place, for sumptuousness and uniformity of structure , is reputed the most costly Building and most glorious Fabric in the whole 'Emuratb. A11 the Marble whereof it is built , seeming to outvy the Snow its self for whiteness, is brought hither, not without vast trouble and Charges,from the Mountains of Ehvend. The Kings Palace, called VoU'let , or Sehach chane is also a very stately House.

The chief Customers which those Public Houses have, are the Barbers, who frequently haunt them to be imploy'd in shaving their Heads: but every man that is able to buy a Raior always carries one about with him, being very fearful! of the Venereal Murrain which they call life hi ^ and we- the French Pox, or som such thing.

On the 16 of February , was the Epiphany celebrated by the Armenian and Georgian Christians. So soon as I heard what was the matter, I rose pretty early in the morning with intent to fee the Solemnity of the Day. The first I met was the fcfaulcor, or Great Marshal with all his fubordinat Officers, who were ordered to prevent Tumults, and not to suffer Horses and Camels with any Burthens to pass over the Bridges and thro the Streets that lead to Tzulfa and Tzar bag ; which was not only don for the fake of the Christians, but upon the account of one of the Kings legitimat Wives , whom he entirely loved, being a Georgian by birth and educated in the Christian Religion , and had a desire to go and see the Solemnities performed, which the King would not deny her, for that she was great with Child. About 8 in the morning were all the Christian Ladies in Balconies, which were all hung with Tapestry, and those of the greatest rank with Canopies over head. Those of meaner degree sateon each fide the River Sendemt , and had a Guard of Soldiers under the Command of an Officer, to secure them from being abused by the Mahometans -, and to suffer no Men to crowd in upon them. About 9 assembled all those under Spiritual Orders and the Clergy belonging to the 10 Churches of Tsulpha -, and the 2 Churches of Ispahan . Those were all attiredin white Stoles and Capps of Cloth of Gold upon their Heads, > with long Labels hanging down to their middle, but more gorgeous was the Attire of the Patriarch , being all over richly embroydered ■ with Gold and adorned with costly Gems. Every Priest carried a Silver Cross hung with litlc Silver Bells and Basons. The Crosses which were carried by those of higher degrees and in the formost Ranks were supported, each by 3 Men. The Inferior Clergy sol- - lowed after with lighted Tapours in their Hands, accompanied' with the most eminent of the Laity.

But before the Procession was ended it began to snow very hard, which did not only cause the King to leavthejn but put a stop to the further Celebration of this great Festival, which, by the preparations , seemed to be intended to be solemnized with very great Pomp : for besides the Contribution of all the Christians , who, as I have elsewhere noted, are very rich - the King fends the Patriarch a considerable Sum of Money fem time before, in order to the carrying on and maintaining this anniversary Custom. The Patriarch and Superior Clergy seeing there was no hopes of the Weather growing better , they departed without performing the ritual Ceremonies: but the Laity continued Dancing and Singing all the Night long. In the mean while the Caravan was in a readiness to depart for Gm- meron , and the Heer Bent gave order for Horses and Camels to be bought up for us, to carry our Provision and Baggage.

At last after much enquiry I found one, but coming back understood that my Portmantle and my Money was stole, which put me in a great strait for I had not above the value of 25 gild , [or 55 sh. sterlings left I suspected that som of our Company was the Party that had committed the Theft, and had also a privat hint given me of it. The matter concerned me so far, that 1 forthwith began to tax the Party with it that I had in suspicion , but he stoutly denied it, and was so displeased at me for blemishing-his Reputation , that he intimated the matter to som of his Companions, wno unanimously swore to be revenged on me and taking their opportunity fell all together upon me , and used me in most cruel manner. It was the Brother of the Party that told me, averring that he had seen it , but when he came to confront him; denied every word he spoke to me, insomuch that I was fain lor the time being to be patient, yet fully resolved to have it out of his Hide the first opportunity. That day we travailed 7 Dutch Miles and came at night to a Village formerly called surge flan , now Iesegas.

The said Caraipanfera was nothing inferior to that we had the night before, afwell in respect: of Conveniency as ornament, having much variety of Carved work, as Foliage, Fru- cturage, &c. after the Perjian manner: the Walls also were covered with a neat fort of white glazed Tiles. Near to this Place is the Sepulchre and T omb of the Mother of Schach Solyman , being a fair Monument of Tbt white Marble: hither repair many devout Women to visit the Tomb and pour out their Prayers and Supplications for themselvs and Schach Friends, which I remark'dwas very brief, for they only (according to the general Injunction) push'd the Tomb with their Head 3 times, Mother. and as often stooped to kiss it, then muttered out a short prayer, which doubtless they have by form, and so departed.

On the East are two places of Entry with Marble Stairs, each step being 30 Foot long and 17 of those steps are wrought out of one Stone, which must necessarily, have been a very great one, each step being half a Foot high. Being ascended 3 2 or 3 3 of those Steps we came at a great square ^ Resting place the Walls and Pavement whereof was altogether of hard and polished Marble. On each side were the Images of divers Beasts as Lions , Elephants, Griffins, Horses and others Animals, afterwards we came into a large and spacious place, about 90 Paces square, where were Eight Gates, 4. whereof were 4, Paces and 3 Two Paces wide.

Below stood a hard bright polished Stone, set fast in the Wall which might have served for a Mirror, on which was an Inscription in very ancient Characters such as the modern Persians cannot read.

I had work enough to view all the Images that were up and down, as ofGiants, Lions - Bulls, Griffins, Tygres , The Olympian, or Games of Hercules Battels, &c.

This day, being as I said very bad weather, we hardly travailed 6 Dutch Miles. The next day setting forward we came at night to a Village called Dobba , where we set our Cnrayan down. This Village appeared like a Camp or Army with their T cms , the Cottages being so mean, and the highest house hardly sufficient for a tall man to stand upright, being built only of Reeds and Twigs plated like Basket-work and daubed over with clay. The Inhabitants like the Cottages they lived in were. very poor and despicable People, insomuch that we had not much Divertisement or accommodation there. This day we hardly advanced 5 Dutch Miles. \" On the 4 we set forward and went over very Rocky and hilly way, passing through several villages.

The Date-tree seems to have som harmony with living Am- rht mals, in their Procreation, and have also their Sexes. The Female will not bear any Fruit if planted alone, so that they are always planted o/pro- by Pairs together all along , and indeed do naturally grow so. But the Female growing old will not bear Fruit, unless they take a piece Trees. of the Top-branch of the Male and ingraft it in the Female, which they also do to som young Trees to make them bring forth good Fruit, which would otherwise be of a bitter and odious Tast. I have further remark'd that when the Male and Female are planted a small distance asunder they will lean towards each other, as if there were som mutual sympathy between them. The Inhabitants who have bin, from one Generation to another, used to plant and propagate these Trees told me many remarkable things about them, which because I will not be prolix, I shall ommit.'

The season being sharp and cold we laid on a great pile of wood, and warmed our selvs throughly. The day following in the Afternoon we came to a Town called Scbmm, which I prelume had bin anciently a City and walled in: it hood in the middle of a grove altogether of Date-Trees. It is also a Town of considerable Traffic in consideration of their Manufactu- rie in Cottons, there being very many Weevers. There is also a very fair Market-place, where besides the many Shops of their own Manufactories , are several rich Ware-houfes of Silks and Pcrjim Stuffs, in which they also drive a great Trade and have correspondence with the greatest Marts in all the Countrey round. Besides the great Concourse of Trading- people, they have a Market twice a week for the Boors, which is no small advantage to the,Town. Finding this a very commodious place to rest in, we tarried here 3 days to refresh our selvs, and ease our Camels, Horses .and Mules, having for 3 or 4 days had very bad way and weather. Having sufficiently taken our rest at Schrrim , we set forward and had very good weather, travailing all the day long thro a flat Coun- trey.j and by the. way saw many Noblemens houses , and here and there a Grove of Date trees, and many fair Orchards, so that this was the most pleasant days Journey we had from Ispahan. Here we met a huge Car aym consisting of a great Troop of Men, Camels, Mules , and Sumpter-Horses loaden with rich Indian Wares. The said Caravan came from Gammer on^ruh intended to go by the same Posts we came, being bound for Scam achy and Suripan, In this company I met accidentally with a Persian who had bin our Neighbour at Sci- machy , and delivered him two Letters, the one for my Master Hadfi Byram which was written in Turkish^ and the other for my Wife, which he promised to send for me by way of Smyrna.

About midnight they fell in and fought outright , so that 5 of our Men lay presently under Feet, being in all 37. We fought j oyntly together with good Courage so that we speedily allayed their Fury.. Our Party as we could observe were much stronger than theirs, yet if we had not bin unanimous and faithfull to one another we had not com so well of, for there was not one Man from the greatest to the least, but fought manfully and with a good will, till the very last, when they ran into another Room and ihut the Door after them, which was no small advantage to us: for, when we had them so pen'd up we knew our selvs secure, there being no other Passage for them to com out at. The Door we barricado'd in with huge Stones, and with all our Carbines and Blunderbusses poured in shot upon them, so long, till they began to beg for Quarter. The which we resolved not to giv them, but promised them the liberty zMers to com forth and to stand to our mercy. In the mean while we had observed that several of them lay dead and wounded. After they had consulted a while among themselvs they resolved to com forth, but we refused to let them com all together, but one by one: keeping a nar- ' row watch at the Door that they should not ruih out altogether. Having got them out they were very patient and suffered us to ty them back to back.

On the 24 we set forward again, and at night came to a great Village which we took up for our Stage, having a fair and spacious Can-. Manser a in it. We had no sooner disburdened the Camels, but had 50 or 60 Women who came and proffered us Milk to fell, and were soimportunatandtroubleibm, that we could not get rid of'em, till we set the Doggs upon them. These went all with their Face uncovered , which I had not seen any Honest Women in all Pasta do, except in one Village between Scam achy and Ispahan. This day we had furthered our Journey by 7 Miles. On the 25'we had a great and wearisom Mountain to travail over at the Foot whereof was a River which we were forced to wade thro, by reason that the stone-bridge which had formerly lain over it was broken down. After we had travailed 5 Dutch Miles we took up our nights, rest in a Caraisansera, But we could here get no manner of Refreshment , the Countrey round about being dry. and barren, producing nothing but Date-trees, that we could fee. On the 26 towards night we came to a Grange of Fifher-mcnof whom we bought a few tor our use. We were no sooner set-down but came Monsr.

Besides the Un- wholfom Airs and Damps, there are many Strangers who destroy themfelvs with drinking of a Liquor much in use there called Pak^ punshen, being compounded of Cerate, Sugar, and R djtns , which is so bewitching that they cannot refrain from drinking it, if they once com to taste it, being very delicious and tempting. It occasions a Giddiness in the Head, Leavers, and Fluxes, and is so corrosiv, that fom who have drunk immoderatly of it and died, being opened , their Bowels were gnawed through and through. The scorching Heat ot that Clime also renders the Earth very dry and barren so that there is little or nothing that grows about it, five only Dates, which like best in sandy and dry ground, but as for Gardens they are very rare to be seen except here and there a little one which with great trouble and continual Watering bring forth a few Potherbs , and Roots.

In the mean time the Inhabitants of Aflrachan began to murmur and breath Rebellion , inciting one another against the Govcrncur and Magistracy, which seemed to be a very .-bad Omen at some ill Consequence, for from .that time forward they continued bolder and bolder till at length it burst out into palpable Rebellion. About this time arrived a Dutch Chirurgeon at Aflrachan y: who had bin in-the Retinue 0/ the Mofzovian Ambassador at Ispahan, of whom I bought som Siik Rusts and 480 Hides of Turkj leather, for which I immediately tendered the Money. ABOUT the beginnings! think the _ph day) of^aweeanre a Gentleman from Cbor- no'/ar with very unwelcom News. IT is- Message was that the fame day that Knees Simcun Ivanowitz. with the Ruffian Army Was arrived before that City, the Co flacks appearing far more numerous and strong , those in the City revolted , declared -themfclvs Coffacks y a'srd furrendred up the Town to Radzjn and the Rebclls. He ; added further, That all the loyal Officers who indcavored to diffwadc them there from, were most inhumanly massacred. This sad Express, altho smothered as much as was possible by the V/aywod and Council of 'Afirachan was nevertheless come ■ to the knowledge of the Townsmen , who were very impatient to bear the yoke of Obedience any longer. Upon this news I was sent for by the lVaywod, who asked me if my Men were able to manage the Cannon, and gave order that in the sirst. ' place all the Cannon should be visited that lay upon the NCalls., an<ito repair those r drat were defoctiy which was forthwith done."}, {"page_label": "Seite 452", "page_text": "[366] ON Thursday the $th. of/W, we left the Ship , and brought all the Goodsinta the Fort, by order of the Governor, our Gunner alio loaded a great part of the Ordnance. Still continued whispering and murmuring againstffie Governour, so that neither He, nor the Council, durst appear without doors for fear of an Uproar. The Chirurgeon of whom I have already made mention, having bin conversant about 14 years with the Ruffes, and not unacquainted with their tumultuous spirits, told me, he could easily foresee that the City would be betray'd ere long, if the Common fort did nut better marks and clearer evidence of Security; and without doubt we that were Strangers and in service of the Great Duke must expect somwosull Catastroph: and therefore since our Pay was retracted , and our service only aboard the Ship sand not in the Land Army, it was more advisable to betake our selves over the Caspian Sea to the Perstan Coast. I had already ordered our Men to buy up 18 Moneths Provision ofNeccstaries, fearing a Siege. UPON this Motion ot the Chirurgeon I summoned up my Officers and took ' Council together with them, what was best to be don in this cafe: they unanimously resolved that it was more secure to betake our selves to flight, since we had no Pay, and therefore not under any obligation to serve the Duke by Sea, much less by Land, They were willing to leave all they had at Aflrachan except only their cloaths, be-, cause it would beanincumbrancc: yet because I had many costly Cloaths and other Goods, they resolved to take as much as they could with them, and packed all up in a great Portmantle and a Trunk which Iliad, besides two little Chests, which I assented to. Every one took as much Provision of Bread in his own Portmantle as he thought might serve him ; and it was resolved that we should leave none behind, save only 2 Seamen, who had each a Wife and a young Child. On Friday in the Afternoon my best Things were brought aboard , it being intended that we should depart that night, which the two Scamens Nssives coming to perceive would by all means go with us. But I weighing well the Entcrprize with my self, and considering the danger of adventuring with 22 Persons more, in a Shallop of 26 Foot long, I thought it not good to cflay the matter. I had with me one Cbriff an Brand my Gunners Mate, with whom I resolved to stay and see what the event would be at Astracban , and (if our fate was such) to die on the Bed of Honour, rather than to flee we knew not whither. This I intimated to the Master and the Doctor who also were content to venture their Lot. Immediatly I sent a Seaman to the Masters Mate aboard the Shallop to acquaint them with the Alteration of my Resolution; but that night the Gates were shut sooner than the customary hour; so that he could % not get speech to them. This put me into some doubt, fearing that they might put off without me: but the Master and two Seamen perswadedme to the contrary saying they would never have the boldness to go without me .which for that time made me rest contented. That Evening I went the Rounds with the Vice-roy upon the Walls of the Castle, which was laid ore with Heaps of Stones, to use in case of Storm. O N the seventh of fune , being Saturday early in the morning, I sent a Seaman to the Ship again with som privat Instructions ; but he making som delay, and I not have the patience to wait any longer went my self, with the Chirurgeon, and found that they '1 ' iobc) .\" 6 \"' ifatl stead; it from •set 1 klore liot'd lath ' TH iicrffl ralipi i said hi , TT to vis \"k' m its ids of on j Men I our A vice v Prod I thy 1 \"n ■ be dr Men j 11 t: !® dm tut its f& 0 % r"}, {"page_label": "Seite 453", "page_text": "\"olt loa:, J -'filjttf 3te itffi cftlra: itktiyj it'l;; ijJjM.

The Master and the rest were (or seemed' to be) surprized at the matter , as not belecving they would have had the boldness to go without further order. 'Tis true it seemed not so strange to me being only what I expected from them. However we concluded it the fiffixt way for our own security to acquaint the Waywod with the matter, before he should come to hear it from others, and with one to let him know the reason. But he who was my'Interpreter was also fled with them, so that I was fain to make use of the Chirurgcon before mentioned. Having acquainted the Governour with what had passed, he show'd himself outwardly not to be much concerned, especially when. I told him that they were not gone over to the Cofackj, THE same day came a Courier with an Express from Moscou, being the fame Gentleman who had brought the news how that the Ruses about Zaritfa were revolted. This Gentleman's name was Danile Tourlekojof , and had been formerly with me a- board our Ship upon th cWolga, between Cafan and Afir ach an , and intimated me with privacy how that the Revolting Party had used the Lievtenant General and other Ruffian Officers after a most barbarous manner , and that Afirachan it self, as well as all the Countrey round about, was already betray'd: but further said he not. ,THE day following, being the 9th of June,\\ received an order from thcGovernour to visit the Fortifications of the City. The like orders had an English Colonel, who was come hither from Terki which City was was also fortified anew by the said'Coll, being situated in the Land of the Circas-Tartars, about 2 Leagues from the Caspian Sea : The old City, or Castle, as AdamOlearius writes, was first built and fortified by one Cornelius Claafz, t aHellander. This Gentleman had the charge of one Quarter committed to him, and my self the other, to repair it so, that the Men might be secure; Soon after came the Waywod himself in person and desired our Advice what to do for Security of the Town. The English Qentlcmans advice was to make some Outworks without the \"Walls : but I advised him to make Proclamation that all such as had any way revolted or engaged themfelvs to the Cofac Party should be pardoned , and declared free Remmisfionaries, in cafe they would come and submit themfelvs to the Governour and that the Townsmen should have some money distributed among them, and the most popular to be drawn in by promise of Advancement and the like; so that those being leading Men might appease the rest : However my advice in that was rejected. ME AN while a narrow \"Watch was held , and the Soldiery lay all night upon the Walk, and 2 Men at every Port-hole,. to be ready in case of a silent Attacque. THE Persians , Calmuc- and Circas-Tartars , under conduct of a PersanGcn- tleman, who was there upon his way to the Court at Moscou , upon an Ambassagc from the King of Persia, did also their utmost indeavor^ to affist us, and passed a- way the night with Music, Dancing and other Mirth. The Post assigned them v as the Poet Nietz.e Bafna , being the Bulwark where they usually torturetheir Malefactors. ON Sunday, being the 15 th. of fune I was invited to dinner with the Waywod, When the Table was done he gave me a Present, to wit, a yellow Silk Coat, 2 pa ire"}, {"page_label": "Seite 454", "page_text": "i>8] pair of Creeches and 2, shirts, that being the Custom of the Ruffians upon extraordinary Occasions [forsooth] He also made me many fair promiies, besides the freedom of his House and Table for my Good service, having about ieo Men under my Conduct: nor did I appear too remiss in my duty, for I went the Rounds every night osier than my Order and Injunction was, THE Thursday following, being the 19'se we had Intelligence how that the Cof*c Forces were greatly increased and that they were a Marching towards us ; which news continued and was consirmed by a continual recourieof Land Tartars andFiihers into jjjlrachan. There was also a false rumor spread about the Town, as if our Men that were fled hadloadcn the Cannon thatlayupon the \"Walls with loose Powder, others that it was with Balls and no Powder, and a third, that it was first with Balls and then with Powder, all which coming to the Governours Ear he sent for me, but coming to worm the Guns in his prefencefound itwasbutafalleandma. licious report railed by some prejudiced Persons to cast an odium upon them and to turn me out of Favour. ON Friday the 20th, of fttnc, the Waywod made me Lieutenant Coll. in place of fames VVondr am, which by provision I took upon me, but being not'.tell pleased with my Charge, the Co!!, who observed it, secirsid a little discontented, and said in presence ofthc Governour, That it was not now a lit time to solicit in for Inch things , whence I collected that he thought that I had made it my business to be advanced^ but was soon after better informed, when he would himself have confirmed me in the Regiment and I with great earnestness declined it. The Postwhiclrwas assigned me was in the fame Quarter with the Col 1 , on the Tartarian side, where the Fort was the weakest. ON Sunday, funs 22 came the Co sacks within sight\" of aistrachan, and sent a Cofac Trumpcttcr with a Ruffian Priest to demand the Town. The laid Cofac had also a Letter fo'Mnc in Butch, wherein I was advised not to sight with my Men , if I hoped for Quarter, or Mercy at their hands. The said Ferrer was taken from me by the Wajivod, before I had read it quite out, and torn in Pieces. ThcTrum- petter and Priest had Gaggs put in their Mouths, that they should cause no commotion or alteration among the Commons; and were soon after beheaded. ON Munday came the Cofac-Army with about 300 Keels, great and small close to the City, pitting in at a River near the Vineyards that 1 v nbont half n Lcnguc from the \\vsolls -of the Town. Upon this we let the 'Tartarian Tents on sire. Mean-. while I stood upon the top of site Governours house, with the Governourhim- sest, and casually espied several Boats in the River before the Town: I therefore .advised the Governour not to let them tarry there for a'thb they were but Hihcrs Boats y.ct they might give intelligence to the Enemy ; wherefore he gave order imme- stiatly to sink them, wttich was forthwith put in execution. That afternoon the Perfuws and Cireat-Tarteirs had taken 4 Cofucks , who were put to the Rack and after confession, two were hanged up, and other two beheaded in presence of the Governour. THE day following the Col! on el would have confirmed me in the Office I tren supplied, to wit, as Lieutenant Colonel which I nevertheless declined as before, i ins fame day about noon the Great Dukes Factor presented us with a Pipe orstrong Beer, t\"r, jiit'tr m •Iffitb (dps it fij rd ar, > see: using tkttln \"itii a could told ir polfibl list iftkc item .pi I advic : far tl finio Chin the! loin -*> Com It! 11 mcl ti, , fatci tors, lot ton me tile Jit dire und ft"}, {"page_label": "Seite 455", "page_text": "[ 36 9 ] Beer , and a Quantity os Tobacco , which we distributed among the Soldiers to give'em Courage and keep them content. In the forepart of the night I went with the Chirurgeon to do the Rounds, which don I lay me down to sleep a little in my Tent but was quickly awaked with the Alarm, which gave notice how that the Co- facks approached to begin their first storm , which happened about 3 a clock at the JVosnaswfke Gate , where our Ship-master and the Waywods Brother had the watch. The first I espied was a square Body of the Enemy who approached very near, upon which I gave fire with our 11 Pounders, and was seconded by those of the next Post, who shot very last. Interim came the English Colonel Baity to me in great hast with most of the Dutch and German Officers, bringing news now that the City was already betray'd. The Colonel was himself wounded on the check with a Pike, as also in two or three places on his Leg, for being all in Armour they could not hurt him elsewhere.' and this he said was done by our own Soldiery. Pie told me further that he had done his utmost indeavour to pacify them and ifit were possible to cast an odium upon the Cosacki , as Rebells; but was fain to smother all his reason sore against his will and at last glad to come off with his Life. After a small conference together I advised the Colonel to go again to his Post, and fee if the perswasion of other Officers had wrought any thing upon the Strelitzers: .but the next news I heard was that the Strelitz.ers had massacred all the Officers, which grieved me most highly , because that they had adventured their persons by my advice. Neither did this bloody Action hold up with that, for it came forward lo far that Captain Wederos who had the next Post to me was taken by his own servant, pinion'd fast and afterward in most cruel manner murthered by his Soldiers. The Chirurgeon of whom I have already made mention seeing this, would have thrown himself off the wall to avoid the danger of those bloody Traitors; but I did all I could to with-hold him, and at last called to mind a certain Port-holc just under the Tower which might serve ussoran Exitus out of all those imminent dangers, in which we had certainly suffered if we had not taken care betimes. Thro this we took our way and I charged the Chirurgeon with his Servant (being a Pole) to follow me, asalsotwoofourShips-Folk, to wit, famesErappen , and Chrijlian Brandt. Coming below we found there two Ruffes; who stood Sentinel, whom I charged to let us through. These not knowing any thing of the Tumult let us thro without much difficulty or Interrogations. The Chirurgeon went out before, and I followed, but knew not what became then of the two Seamen and the Pole. We were forced to wade thro the Ditch to the neck, aiming at the Tartarian Field Quarters, which, as I have said, was burnd up that it might not be an advantage to the Enemy., which place we held for the most safe and secure. Thev shot at us mainly from the Walls , but all to little purpose for we were got pretty far without Cannon reach , at lest for single Bodies: But marching a little forward we met two men, whom we supposed to be Cosacki , the Chirurgeon having a Firelock resolved to discharge as he also did , and so far surprised he was that he grew desperate and throwing himself into the River fell a swimming. When I came up with them I understood that they were also sled for fear of being massacred by the Commonalty; upon which I called out to the Chirurgeon that they were honest Men and under Aaa the"}, {"page_label": "Seite 456", "page_text": "[ 37 °] the same Circumstances we were ourselves, &c. but could have no answer from him. However not willing to leave him so, I went to look out for him, and found him among the Reeds half spent, whence I drewhim out, and perceiving him to be in away of Recovery marched forward along the River; and at last found a fellow steeping in a stoat , whom we awakened and compelled to bring us over to the other fide: but finding no place of shelter or security we fell down the River, and about 10 in the forenoon came to a Fistiing place called Trofllz.en Outzjyouge , where we related all what had pasted at Aflrachan to the Filhcrs. We would have gone further, but the Ruffians would not go with us. However I prevailed so far with the Chirurgeon that he was willing rather to go toSea, than to trusthimfelfto the mercy of the Cofack/. But he was very loth to trust himself in such a small Boat, being w T ell acquainted with the danger by untemperate Winds, inconstant Seasons, and uncertain Tides. I had no more money by me than 7 Rubbels [about 3 !b. Sterl.] and bought a Mug-tent or Pavilion with a loaf of Bread weighing about iolb.and with that put off, trusting to the Providence of Almighty GOD, having the advantage of the Tide. After two hours rowing we met 2 Fishers Boats, to whom we related how affairs stood at Aflrachan. The Filhers gave us very good words and comfortable Language, promising to assist us in what they might. We rowed as hard as we could, and bare them company to their Filhing place, called Ivanowa Outz-joug, where we met with a Ruffian Colonel, 2 Captains and 46 Strditz.tr:. The Colonels name was Maxim Lopatim , and lay in Garrison at Terkg intending for Aflrachan , but had not as then heard of the horrid Treason and Rebellion of the Commonaltie there, nor so much as of the Attacque and Siege ofthe C\"/kc^r. He understanding how affairs stood there, resolved to row back with us in the Boat to Terk^y, and advising the two Captains to do the like who put their Goods aboard, and tacitly left the Str elitz.tr s at Ivanowa Outz.oug. Thus we rowed with all our might, till we got the Caspian Sea, still keeping near the Bank. After alittle rowing we espied a Boat which rowed very hard after us: we also did all we could to outrow them, but they being more expert than we in general, gain'd room of us, and coming near our boat , one of the^ Ruffian Captains jump'd over board, and was afterwards taken up by them. All the Arms we had was my Pistol, for the Chirurgeon had thrown his into the'Water, when he swam to fave himfelfwithout-^/rs- chan, as I have already, mentioned. In the Keel or Vessel that followed us were several Fishers, together with the Strelitz.ers, which were formerly under the Command of those Officers that were with us ad left at Ivanowa Outzeug, who it seems so resented the matter that they had declared themselves Cosac^s , thro disgust that the Officers had not given them warning of the affairs oi Aflrackan, who probably would have bin faithful] if they had bin so kind as toacquainrtbem with the matter. In short they closed up with us, took, plundered, bound and brought us back again to the Fishing place, where the Colonel alone had the Liberty to exercise his Devotion in the Church, but we were secured with a strong Guard all the night long. O N Thursday the 250s fluty they made preparation to bring us up to Aflrachan , and about noon we got sight of the Town: and coming to a very convenient place to i Itiagn rireica 1 tay st .

The Chirurgeon intimated the matter to the Colonel, desiring that he would joyn indeavours with us to get free: but (whether out offear, or in hopes of better usage at the hands of the Rebells I cannot tell) he forthwith discovers the design, and gave the Rebells warning to^have a care: upon which they seta watch and guarded us so strictly that we could not make our escape. Seeing that our Enterprise proved abortiv and ineffectual, I told the Chirurgeon that I would run a little up the Island and swim over the Water to the Tartars , which I essay'd to do, but was follow'd and taken; yet had that attempt not bin in vain if I had not chanced to fall which was no small disadvantage to me : however I betook me to the Water which I found there very shallow, so that they with a little wading fetched me out. But having got me, I cannot express with what cruelty they used me, beating me black and blew, which done, they bound me fast and threw me into the Boat, so rowing up to the Town. By the way the Chirurgeon made a proposal to them that if they would save us alive, they should have ioo Rabbets for my Ransom and 70 for his own. They promised to do their Indeavour for us. In the Evening we arrived at yljlrach.m where we were brought up before the General of she Cofacs . I had no Cloaths about me save only a pair of leathern Breeches, which were full of holes. The General fate at the Gates of the Bishops Palace erofs- legg d after the Turkifj manner drinking Brandy, and was so drunk that hisEies roll'd in his Read. He asked the Chirurgeon who he was? and what his Function was ? which when he knew, gave him his Life, and ordered him to take care of the Cofres that were wounded. Afterward he asked, who I was? the Chirurgeon made answer that I was his Companion .* he further asked me what I#otiJd do; buc the Chirurgeon leaving me, I could not return him any answer. 1 he Ruffian Colonel being examined , was immediately carried up to the top of a Tower called Roofcat , and hurled headlong down. From the fame Tower also was the Vice-roy, or Waywod , w hose name was Ivan Simeunowitz. Projorsfski , after many Tortures thrown also praecipitantly from Top to Bottom, as also the Vice-Chancelor with all the Officers, of what degree soever they were, either thrown down , or cast into the Water. MOST dread full was this massacre which continued for some time together; but G O !) Almighty gave me an undaunted spirit. The Cofac General looking earnestly upon me commanded his Men to give rr.c Brandy , and made me drink off i cups one after another, and then gave order to bring me into the Camp : But what became of the 2 Ruffian Captains I cannot tell. As I passed by to the Camp being put in a Boat that lay next to the Generals, I was espied ofa Ruffian StreUtz.tr who brought news of my being still alive to Madam Wonderham , the Lieutenant Colonels Wsiddow. I have already made mention how that among the Dutch Officers that went out with the said Lieutenant Colonel, was one Paul Rudolph his Son in Law who was the only Person that remained alive: feigning himself in such extremity to be a Cofac , for he was well acquainted with their speech and manners.

In this posture I lay my self till Friday June 27, expecting every moment my last Catastroph. That day they brought me into a Tower, and tied me so hard, that my blood for want of a natural reflux began to corrupt within my Body. My Arms were pinion'd, and my hands made fast behind my Back: my feet also were so hard bound that I never expected to have the use of them again. Lying in this Posture and most lamentable state I spent my Time in sighing and groaning. The Chirurgeon of whom we have already spoke came' to vilit me : I desired them to sollicit for my Death, but they ever dislwaded me from it. Yet still linsisted very hard that they would make intercession for me to the General that I might be dispatched, giving them a private reason for that my earnestness. Now there was a Rule among the Cosacks , that if any came to interceed for a Captiv that he should dv himself for him, which the Chirurgeon told me also, yet promised he would adventure himself to the General, and for that time took his leave. THISnightl was most barbarously used by the Cosacks, and Gogelats , aPeopIe of Vkrain so called. And in the meantime was most fearfully vexed with Toads and other vermin that continually ran over my Body and about my head in whole swarms. However I spent my time in prayer as one condemned to dy and assured of a speedy Death , of which (I may truly declare) I was not in the lest affraid, only feared that they would hang me up by the Heels, or put me to some such lingr- ing death, with which they continually threatned me. ON Saturday the 28 of June came the aforesaid Chirurgeon, and told me that the General had sent for me: and being untied I could hardly stand upright, yet made a shift t\" hupplc after him. Being come in to the presence osthe General after a few idle impertinent Questions he asked me bad me go borne with the Chirurgeon. From Sunday to Thursday I continued there in house with him, in which time I saw mudi cruelty commited\" some hanging up by the Feet, others with their Feet and hands chopt off left in the open street to shift for themselves , none daring so much as put forth a fin ger to help them. ON Thursday July 3d I was again taken and carried to the Brink of the River where I expected to part with my Life. But the Cosacks told me, if I would pay the too Rubbles , which the Chirurgeon had promised them on my behalf, I might go free: which the Chirurgeon, who against his will feigned himself to he a was content to disburse for me, which afterwards I was obliged to repay upon demand when able. ON Sunday I was sent for by the General, who was then a Drinking at the Emperors Cellar, but nothing of moment passed at that time he being drunk, and forced me to drink off several Bowls ofBrandy and Wine after one another, so that I was affraid to displease him, being (as I have elsewhereremembredj very outra- giouswhen drunk ; wherefore I took occasion to steal out of his presence.

The Day following they were both found alive, and the youngest at the intercession and Mediator of some of Radzins Minions was taken down, and saved alive, but the eldest was thrown down from the Top of the Tower, whilst still alive, which was the Death his Father suffered. Fhe fame day I had News how that Christian Brand one of my Men was still alive - and was constrained to feign himfelfas Co sac. On the zo th of July the Cofac General Radzin departed with an infinte number of small Shipping and several 1 Thousands of Men , drawing 20 Men out of each Company to serve for the Garrison at Ajlrachan and left there 2 Governors ofequal Command and Power, the one being a Cofac, and the other a Russ. O N the 2 of Augufi began a New Massacre continuing for several days together , where takeing one day with another , were 1 50 Persons killed , sparing neither lex nor Age. For which reason I began to hunt out for a Cave in the Earth where I might save my self in time of need, hearing of nothing but a perpetual and incessant massacre; and a general Lamentation of Parents for their Children, \"Wid- dorvs and Orphans for their Husbands and Fathers, and that as well among those who had bin instrumental and most forward to let in the Rcbells, as others that opposed it; a just reward fortheir Treachery who had been assistant in the Bloodshed' of those who under GOD should have protected them from such dismal Calamities. ABOUT this time I dispatched three Letter for Ispahan and had notice how that Christian Brandt was set free. It seems that he was taken for a Persian , having a brown, swarthy complexion, and by such means was spared in the massacre; for all the Dutch were hewn down , or otherwise dispatched, save oncly L. Fabritim Son in Law to Captain Rudolph. ABOUT the same time I had news by the Chirurgeon \" how that my Ships- company that betook themselvs to flight with the Shallop were run aftrandon the- 'Scemkal orDage/lan Coast, a Countrey butting out against the Cafpi/m Sea, ON the 22 of Augufi was much Tyranny committed in the City, and people- of al! ages massacred. The Chirurgeon after a long soliciting pfocured aPafport to depart with a Servant to attend him, altho not without giving Security for his Return. This gave me like wise opportunity to lea ve the placeunder pretext of being his Servant. ON Munday in the afternoon being Aug. 25 weleft Asrachan andimbarqued our selves aboard a Vessel belonging to some Banyan Merchants, who were also pillaged and robbed of all they had. A aa 2, ON-"}, {"page_label": "Seite 463", "page_text": "[ 37 *] ON Tuseday we eame to Sea, failing close by the Coast and to the Southward, We also saw 3 small Vessels, or Barks which indeavoured to keep Company with us. Having palled SettinaboGora the Wind wasfflat North, and about the Evening all was calm. T H E Day following one of the above mentioned Shipping hailed us, and said that they were bound for Terki and came from Aftrachan being laden with Salt. We kept them Company along the Coast near the broken Land which is all grown over with huge tall Reeds: we had n and 12 Foot Water. At night one of those Vessels stray'd about a Cannon shot from us: and the next morning 2 Barks made up towards us and gave Fire, without doing any Execution: But when they came near us the cowardly Banians fell upon their knees and begged their Lives. In each Boat were 9 Persons and aboard of us were 46, some Persians , Tartars andBouchars, hut most Banians. Coming to board us they plundered all to our very Provision. I had about 8 Rubbles in Money and my Seal-ring which had bin once already redeemed from the Cofacs. This Ring with the Money I gave to the Chirurgeon; but they threatningto put him to the Torture when it came to his turn to be pillaged; he confdlcd all and delivered up the Money and Ring, besides 4 double Ducats of his own : but found an opportunity to hide 52 Ducats more after an especial manner about his Body. W HEN the Cofacks had taken all and pillaged us of what they could find, they held a certain sort of a Council among themselvs whatthey should do with us. At last it was resolved after a long debate, that we should be saved alive but turned off to Sea, with charge not to come anigh the Coast any more, upon pain of being thrown over board if they came to take us again. UPON this they left us, and gave us opportunity to make use of the Wind, which > was Westerly, and about the Evening with a brisk Gale, and a dark moon we set fail and bore up to the Sea. BUT after we had failed about 2Leagues the Weather began to befomwhat boistrous, so that we were fain to put in at a small Creek of an Island , where we lay at Anchor till Saturday following ; at what time the Weather growing more calm and temperate we weighed and bore up again to the Coast , where we imme- diatly descried 2 Barks that made up to us , and at last came clolc by the board. The Chirurgeon and I had taken our last Farewel of each other, expecting nothing more than Death. In short, they fell a plundering us, and I to pass for a B anjan had anointed my self with Black tempered withGrcace, and tied a Handherchcifabout my Head , but it was to botchingly don that they found occasion to ask the Chirurgeon, what for a Black Devil that I was? In the mean while they searched very close for Bread and Provision which I seeing pointed to my mouth, whereupon they were so merciful as to return mea part of the Provision back again. TwoLse- gefian Merchants were thrown over board and the Chirurgeon who passed for a Pole was most severely beat. They threatned that if they met us again near the Coast that we should have no Mercy at their hands. Meanwhile I had lost mv little Compass, so that we had no other help in directing our Course, than only the Sun and North-star. Towards the Evening it began! to blow hard again and the Pyrats left us, &"}, {"page_label": "Seite 464", "page_text": "\"OIBjjv \\k lia^; idliiir Sit pfeiE \"b(!*t : 'HibJ;: 'kchch wiIbt ■ cktts- ■tokii œitfe ih : loiii: tislJB.

The Surgeon had again hid his Gold in a place where they did not once make search for it. THE Wind continued hard till Thursday following, blowing mostly from North-W. and by N. and now changed again into W.N. W. which was good and favourable for us; but the Banians would in no wuse give their consent that we should weigh Anchor, for that they thought it too high and boiftrous. B UT on Saturday the Wind continuing still in the fame point, we weighed, and with a fresh Gale steered away South and by West; and loon alter descried a small V estel riding at Anchor, being one of those that left Astraoban with us: those aboard were Persians and had the luck to escape the Cosacks, keeping oft\" at Sea. When they saw who we were, they weighed and kept us company. Towards the Evening the Wind blew North-East , and I found that we had failed too much Westerly, I pressed hard that we should alter our course, but could not prevail with them to steer another way: so that in the Morning we found ourselves close to the Coast, and had the \"Wind at East and by N. With this fort of Shipping it is very difficult to steer without 12 points of the Compass Wind to their advantage. HOWEVER we thought good to keep close to the Coast, but towards the Even- ing it growing calm we rowed oft to the Seaward and lost the other Veslel. Meanwhile we began to be distressed for want of Provision, and fed of the crums of moldy Bread: and the greatest part of the Company had no more to eat. But the were best provided, and imparted to us such as they had. INTERIM, the Wind came about East, and E. and by S. so that we were constrained to drop Anchor , and so to ride three days at half a fathom Water. Yet growing calmer we ever now and then rowed a little. But having spent all our wood were at a great lols for Fewel to bake bread, of that little quantity of Meal which the Banians had left: and were fain at last to cut up some parts of the Ship for Chips , which stood us in very good stead. The Wind then continued Easterly and we steered as far Southerly as we could, till on the ioth.of September towards the Evening we came to a good place of Anchorage, near the Coast, of 5 Foot water, where I stcptalhoar to feck up some Wood and Herbs, ot what else I thought might be serviceable t© us on our Voyage. ON Thursday being the n\"h. of September we sailed close by the Coast which we kept in fight till Saturday following, when as the Banians , a poor and helpless People not able to endure such hardship, pressed very hard that we should put ashoar, which out ofmecr pity we were willing to do, being all wet and very cold. MEANWHILE we were set upon by a party of Cosacks , who now the third time plundered us : but the Chirurgeon not having time nor the conveniescy to hide his Ducats as before, digged a hole'and hid them in the and, and threw down his Musquet about the same place for a token to find them again. I also being afraid, ran and hid my self among the Reeds ; but they making a very narrow scrutiny found me out: and having by me a Psalmbook found that passage or Title of a Psalm, where David is said to have feigned himself mad before the PUUpnes to escape them, I resolved to do the like, by which means I escaped, When they had me they"}, {"page_label": "Seite 465", "page_text": "[ 376 ] they disputed what Countreyman I was, and some of them said I was a Dutchman: but others said I was a Georgian, and to my Happiness the latter iway'd it. However (not without wounding and killing of some of our Company they let us go, and themseivs departed from us: which the Chirurgeon feeing went and after much seeking found his Gold. O N the 20 of September it was very good \"Weather; we therefore made ready to set sail. About noon bcingundersail we saw about 30 Tartars on the Strand who called out to us that we should comcaihoar: This unwelcom summons mainly added to our fear; insomuch that one of the Banians ran ashoar and fell down upon his Knees. The Boat was drawn ashoar, and after they had consulted a little together what they should do with us they demanded Ransom, which was agreed upon for z Rubbles each Man. They were Circas and Nagayan Tartars , and accepted of one of the Banians for a Pledge till the Ransom was paid. We went about two Miles with them and left our Vessel behind us. I had with me a little Coffer ofBooks which I carried along with me; and was fain to trudge afoot without either Shoes or Stockings thro Thistles and Brambles, insomuch that my Feet were all blistered and bloody. Towards the Evening we came in a Bay where their Shipping lay. Here I met with an Armenian whom I had formerly known at Astrachan who treated me very kindly > as also my Companion the Chirurgeon : but we having in so long a time not eaten any thing which was fitting for human food, did Anatomize what was set before usat such that the Armenian observing it, thought good to takeaway before we had half satisfied ourappetiteforfearwc should surfeit our selves. H E R E we tarried three Days\" waiting for a good Wind to go (otTarku, but that not falling out in this time arc determined rather to go by land than to stay there Wind-bound, it being not above a Days Journey, yet very perillous for the Tartars who continually lay in wait for distressed, and stranded Passengers, in these unhappy Proceedings of the Cofaekii who made the Caspian Sea very unsafe to sail. ON Tuseday being the zoos September we set forward - and after a very tedious Days Travel thro Boggs and Marshes we got to a Village inhabited by Nagajan Tartars : where we took up our nights rest in the Circas Quarter. Here we met with a Friend ofthe Chirurgeons, whom we offered 8 Ducats to conduct us to D erbettt, which he undertook to do. Here I spoke also with IvanTurkpn Agent to his Imperial Majesty, who was a Turkjootn, but a AEKj/htK Proselyte, and had a Brother at M feiu who was of the Reformed Religion and an intimate Friend of mine. This said Gentleman intreated me to stay longer at Terku, but I declined their kind offer yet was fain to accept'of it for 2 Days having so charged and ovcrloaden my stomach with eating that I fell sick upon it. ON the 61 K. of OElober we set forward for Tier bent in company with the Banians. Now by the way you are to note that every day we suffered such hunger, aMans ransom was thrown into the water , which the superstitious Banians hold for a special act of Piety and a Religious Injunction. By the way we met som Thousand of Tartars, for whom we were not a little affraid, they being and noted Plagiaries. after"}, {"page_label": "Seite 466", "page_text": "ski lit:: >\"!tz lajjj liccjv fe.

We staid here uH Munday following being the seventh of OBober. Here I happened to spy a Persian who had my Plulh-Coat on, which he said he had bought at Terku, The Fur or Lining cost me thirty five Rubbles at APufcou; and the Persian was willing to fell it me again for five or six Rubbles , but I could not accomplish to much Money as to purchase it. Here we alto came to understand that myShips- folk who fled in a Challop were stranded and taken staves. ON Thursday the tenth ditto , we came into Terku, where we had two \\Armtnians for our Friends; these also brought me to one of their Acquaintance for Protection j where I was advised to keep my self very private, being a free Prize for the Tartars. Here we also found Lewis Faber or whom I have already made mention, as al/o ChristianBrand one oFmy Ships-folk; who left adjlra-. than three \"Weeks after us, and had been eight Days at Terku. ON the thirteenth we left Terku , and hired a person for eight Ducan. to conduct us to Derbent. ON the seventeenth we pasted by Boynak^, where I understood lorn of our Men were in stavery, I sent our Conduct up to the Town ( not daring appear there my self) with Letters to advise them to persist in the Christian Faith, if they were press'd upon to embrace Mahomctanism with promise of doing my best to procure their Redemption. But my Squire the Courier, thought good to give us the Bag, having already got his Money in hand, nor did I ever hear a word from them, altho I gave them directions how to write to me at Derbent. However when I arrived there I found Cornelius de ZJries , who had been my Gunner, and one Peter u4rentfz, of Sceveling, who gave me a perfect account of the Ships-Company, how they were taken Slaves, and whither they were carried , &c. \"WE solicited by the Sultan of Derbent for the Redemption of our. Men, who was pleased to dispatch Letters on that behalf to the Prince of the Calmuc- Tartars-, but having sent two Posts, and all to no purpose or effect, I v\\cnt to tender my thanks to the Sultan for his Civility and Indcavours ; to which he reply'd, \" That he was sorry he could not prevail with the Tartars to answer \"my Desire, yet was willing to do us any kindness that lay in his power, if \"we could imagine any mean whereby they might procure their Liberty, &c. I insisted further to have torn Horses for our use on the Journey which he granted; but there was none to be had in all the Town, the Caravan being but newly set forward for Scamacby. Yet finding another ready to depart, the Seamen went afoot in company of the Caravan. I supplied them alto with necessary Provisions, and told them that I would stay a day, or two longer, to fee if I could get torn Horses and then follow them. But it was in vain , for I could not get any, wherefore I followed the Caravan and coming at Scabran. which is reckoned the halfway, we were informed that there were several Hackneys in the Town , which we hired.
