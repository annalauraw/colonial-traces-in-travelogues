SSaa THE following letters, which contain an account of part of my voyages and travels, were at first only written with the intent of amusing my friend Sir William Fordyce; but as he thought they would afford some information to the curious traveller, as well as amusement to the public in general, he has permitted me to present them to the world, by publishing them. In the early period of my life, nothing was more distant from my thoughts than A that"}, {"page_label": "Seite 9", "page_text": "C \" ) that ever I should become an author; nos could I ever as yet have been induced to entertain that ambition, had it not been in compliance with the wishes of some of my friends, to whom, from necessity and fad reverse of fortune, I have been compelled to lay under many obligations. Solicited by them, as it was the only method by which I could testify my gratitude, I first gave to the public the History and Revolt of Ali Bey. That relation, if nothing else, has certainly authenticity to recommend It, since it was neither a compilation from various authors, nor any account drawn up from hearsay, (as some authors, but more especially Mr. Volney, have since made theirs,) but to the greatest part of what I there wrote I was an eye witness. The following letters, containing the observations which I made in my voyages and 4"}, {"page_label": "Seite 10", "page_text": "( Hi ) and travels, are now presented to the pub* lie, unadorned with any embellishments of art, and have nothing to boast of but their simplicity and genuineness; for as it was not my intention to swell the size of my book, by borrowing accounts from Other authors* and imitate those pretended travellers who sit in their own closets and write their journies over the whole world* no more than compilations from others; I only here offer a concise description of the . various countries through which I passed t for had my intention been to impose on the public a voluminous work, without having recourse to the expedients of plagiary* I could have formed several volumes, of other travels made in former periods of my life, for which my memory would have afforded me sufficient matter.

In the middle of October, in that year, I went to Rusteto, or Canabos, and thence to Alexandria; in this place I remained till the latter end' of December, and then embarked on board a Turkish man of war, in company with Rahip Mahomet Bashaw ; for a relation of mine, under whose guardianship I then was, was in the service of that personage ; in his retinue I went to Petrum, or Halicarnastus. But having pasted the island of Rhodes, and meeting with stormy weather, we took shelter in the port of Maori, or ancient Micali, a very convenient and safe harbour, defended from all boisterous windsw During our stay in this harbour we were very"}, {"page_label": "Seite 12", "page_text": "( v ) very near destroyed by a thunder-bolt, which fell on the main mast, made a hole through the middle of it, descended into the well of the pump, and then came up to the deck through the middle hatch ; it hart four of the Bastiaw's men, who were lying on the under deck, and then pasting by the long boat, near to which was a large sheep of Caramania, which it killed, and thence went to the place where the Bastiaw's horses were kept, and, without doing them any injury, it afterwards went out at a port hole at the head of the ship and disappeared. The mast of our ship was all in flames, which, with the darkness of the night, caused great confusion among the crew of the ship ; not knowing how to extinguish it, after some difficulty they cut it down, and it fell into the sea, by which means we A 3 were"}, {"page_label": "Seite 13", "page_text": "( vi ) were saved : the next morning we saw the frigate, which was in company with us for the purpose of carrying the Bashaw's baggage, without her stern gallery, which had been burnt, but happily extinguished before it had done any other considerable damage. Strange as this phenomenon may appear, it is no less true ; and had not I myself been eye witness, I should not have ventured on the description. I My relation seeing this phenomenon, resolved to continue no longer his voyage, but, hiring a Sakoleva, or country trading vessel, took leave of the Bashaw, and sailed next day for Petrum, or Halicarnassus ; but the wind blowing strong from the Gulph, we were obliged to anchor on the right hand point of it; and having disembarked with our baggage, though it rained very hard all night, we were exposed to the open"}, {"page_label": "Seite 14", "page_text": "( vii ) open air without any shelter whatever. The next morning, however, camels for our baggage, and five horses for ourselves to ride on, were sent by the Governor of Petrum; and we happily arrived at that place the sixth of January 1750, at about five o'clock in the afternoon. During the time that we were waiting for the arrival of the Bashaw and his retinue, Cara Osman Oglou, and other Beys of different provinces, came and brought with them every thing necessary for his reception. Ten days after the Bashaw arrived, and was received by the Governor of that place, Menexis Bey, and the aforesaid Cara Osman Oglou, a very powerful man, together with several other Beys, with great pomp.

Having staid till the Bashaw's people and baggage were come on shore, we parted for Melles, or Melitus, where we staid a few days till the roads were repaired. After a day's journey we pasted the river Meandrus, and in three days after we arrived at Giufel-Issar. Here we staid for fourteen months; at the expiration of which time my relation's indisposition, as well as his private affairs, obliged him to ask permission of the Bashaw to retire somewhere in the country for the benefit of the aff. Having obtained this, we set off for Smyrna, in which place he was taken very ill; but recovering about three weeks after, we hired a vessel to go to Constantinople.

Having re-embarked three days after, we arrived at Constantinople without any other accident. Having staid at this place for six months, I afterwards took leave of my relation, (though much against his inclination,) invested 'my little money in merchandise, and failed for Alexandria ; but as the ship had not cargo enough, we went to Kuffi Adasii, or the Birds Istand, (which is old Ephefus,) in order to load with .wood; while she was loading 1 went on ffiore, amusing myself with the old ruins of that once-famous place, which is at some distance from the present town.

On our passage we visited the Asiatic Islands, Cio- Skiro, and Tino; and, on the Continent, the Mount Athos, Volo, and Cassandria. At last we arrived at Salonikio towards the middle of October, 1751, after a contrary wind of three weeks. The Captain being a Greek, and well acquainted with the place, recommended me to a Greek merchant, by whose assistance I fold my goods, wholesale, at a clear prosit of forty per cent. ; after which I staid in that place till the winter was over. The aforesaid merchant advised me to invest my cash in tobacco and iron bars, of both"}, {"page_label": "Seite 18", "page_text": "( xi ) both of which great quantities are brought from Macedonia and all Thessaly. Having purchased a sufficient quantity, I embarked them on board a Turkiffi merchant (hip, of rather more than a thousand tons burthen, which was wintering there, and was destined for Alexandria ; but before the spring came on, to my misfortune, the Captain died, and a messenger being sent to his family at Constantinople, the (hip was immediately fold, and afterwards ordered to fail for that place ; I accordingly went with it, purposing, if I (hould not find a good price for my merchandize, to re-embark them in another (hip, and go to Egypt.

So it happens with some Authors, who not having in themselves proper knowledge of real transactions, wait till they meet with some authentic account of them in others, and then begin to treat on the same subject appropriating the labour of others to themselves. This fact is manifested in Ali Bey's History and Revolt; whose Author not having any idea of informing the public"}, {"page_label": "Seite 33", "page_text": "( xxvi ) public of the transactions of this unfortunate Prince, kept no minutes while in his service, never thinking he should be reduced to be the narrator of his master's and his own calamities, till some of his friends prevailed upon him to publish a concise relation of the above Prince's life and actions, assuring him that they would affist him in the printing of it; being therefore under obligations to them, and to the public in general, for their kind protection, he was obliged to apply to his own memory for what he was eye witness to; and whatever he has heard, (which may be deemed authentic) not from merchants, but from those who were Beys, and most of them brought up in Ali Bey's palace, especially from that Prince himself while he was Hasnadar, or Treasurer to his master Ibrahim Kia- haya, and simply without applying to or seeing"}, {"page_label": "Seite 34", "page_text": "( xxvii ) seeing any other author's work concerning the above subject, he entertained the public with veracity. Before this publication (which was ten years after the destruction of this unhappy Prince.) No one attempted to inform the public of those transactions, but after it was published, two authors, one an Englishman, and the other a Frenchman, appropriated part of it to their own use, and were modest enough to pass it in silence without finding fault with the author. The third, who calls himself Volney, was not satisfied with that booty, but he moulded and changed it to different shapes, and not only confounded the names, but contradicted the author's simple veracity.

Volney may have some reason for contradicting that part concerning Amazia with that of A baza, which was not the fault of the author, but the corrector's addition, who thought himself well versed in ancient geography, for the author wrote simply Abaza, not thinking it necessary to describe its situation, as his intention was only to mention Al: Bey's native country. But for the other contradictions he objects to, the author thinks he is deceived ; for he first confounds Mahomet .Bey's purchase by the Jew, with that of Ali Bey's; secondly, he is ignorant of Ali.

Likewise he confounds the names of the other Beys who were with him after his retreat from Egypt to Palestine, and evidently strews his ignorance of the true transactions of that Prince. Thirdly, he fays in his notes, that when the merchants heard of the name of Mary, Ali Bey's wife, they laughed at it; to which the author of the History of Ali Bey answers with authority, that not only his eyes were witnestes to such a person, but even in November 1771, had the honour of being permitted by Ali Bey to offer her personally some presents which he had brought with him from Europe.

It has two harbours, one on the east north east, the other on the west; the latter of these affords a good anchorage for ships of all rates, the water being of a sufficient depth ; and on the south and west it is surrounded with hills, except at its entrance, which lies north west.

The castle of this last place is but indifferently built, and badly calculated for defence by land; though by sea, in time of war, it may do great damage to the shipping, it having a battery of large cannon close to the water, and directly opposite to the entrance of the Gulph of Smyrna. The next day, at about three in the morning, we again set fail, and in the evening, about six, we arrived at a port in the coast of Lydia, which has two entrances, one to the north, and the other to the south.

This town is very extensive ; the houses are built in the same stile as those of Smyrna ; the streets are moderately large, the causeways of which are elevated about half a foot higher than the middle.

The other lies to the north, and is chiefly calculated for small vessels. When 1 had seen the cathedral, I went to pay my respects to the Archbishop, whose palace stands in the same spot as that of the ancient princes of Lesbos ; part of the walls of which are to be seen. to this day about eight feet thick.

The other islands, which are to the west of this, though they are uninhabited, are kept in a state of cultivation by the inhabitants of the former. Between these two isles is a fine harbour, which, on the southern part, affords good anchorage for ships of the heaviest burden.

The whole height appears to me to be about a hun- dred-and-forty feet, from the base, and in circumference twenty four. The mosque has a dome, of about eighty feet in height; round which, in the inside, are galleries. The ground is paved with large, square, black and white marble stones, intermixed. It has four doors, one to each of the four points ; before each door is a portico and steps ; except the north, which is level, and has a square court yard before it of about forty feet in diameter; round about are arches supported by pillars, and co- ■ vered with lead, with which likewise the top of the mosque is covered.

DEAR SIR, Jn order to procure time to make my observations, and to view at my leisure this town, I advanced before the caravan, some distance; and as I arrived here early, I prepared to give you an account of my journey, together with a description of this place. Having left Adrianople about four o'clock in the afternoon, and pasted through the western gate, we went over the two bridges, which are across the rivers Arta and Tungia, leaving the latter of these and Maritsa on our left hand. About half after four we pasted near a hill, on which we saw two men impaled. After this, we came to a well-cultivated plain, which, on both sides of the road, presented N 4 to"}, {"page_label": "Seite 239", "page_text": "( 184 ) to us great abundance of wheat, barley, and India corn ; several vineyards too were dispersed in different parts of the country. In the middle of the road is a fountain ; near which, as the weather was very sultry, we stopped to refresh ourselves till about five o'clock. In this plain we continued our journey till nine o'clock, when we halted for the night's repose in a field, at a small distance from the river Maritsa, which, in this place, forming several islands, affords a pleasant view to the traveller. At about half after four in the morning, of the 14th, while the Kiragees were loading their horses, we rode off, a,nd about nine arrived in a village called Musta- pha Bafha, containing about forty or fifty houses, inhabited by Turks and Bulgarians. Haying staid here, for about the space of half an hour, in which time we breakfasted, we proceeded on our journey. As soon as we left this village, we pasted over a stone bridge of a hundred yards in length, and"}, {"page_label": "Seite 240", "page_text": "< ) aud seven in breadth : this bridge is over (the Maritsa, which,in this plain, pursues its course in a very serpentine manner. At half after ten we passed through another village, called the Bisca, in which are about forty huts, inhabited by Bulgarians ; and between eleven and twelve we made a halt for the mid-day's heat. At half after four we proceeded on our journey, and arrived at seven o'clock in the evening at a fountain called Akbolden, which was built about two hundred and twenty years ago by Iwas Balha ; there is on it an inscription in Turkish characters. Having refreshed ourselves at this place, for about half an hour, we advanced as far as a village called Harmanli, containing about thirty houses, none of which are in any manner worthy of mention, if we except the Han, or Inn, of stone, and covered with lead, built by Sinan Bashaw ; it is divided into large rooms, between which is formed a court yard.

The 15th, at about half past four in the morning, we set off, and continued our journey through the most delightful country I ever saw. We were disturb'd in the morning at our usual time by the sweet warbling of the nightingale, and other birds, whose melodious harmony added fresh charms to the country. At ten in the forenoon we came to Ufungiouova, a wretched village, containing about fifty houses, and some huts, inhabited chiefly by highwaymen. While our horses were sent out to grass, we went into a coffee shop to procure some refreshment. In this village is held a fair every year in the month of August, which is frequented by most of the Turkish and Greek merchants. At eleven in the forenoon we left this place, and rode till one, when we put the horses to grafs, and continued till half after"}, {"page_label": "Seite 242", "page_text": "( i8 7 ) after five, when we came to a small village, called Semistee, containing about forty huts, and a few houses. We rode on till eight o'clock in the evening, when we came to another called Cheswat, and encamped that night in a field at a small distance from it. In this village I entered into conversation with a priest, with whom I supped at his house. He was a Bulgarian by birth, and could speak no language but his own and a little Turkish. Having spent the evening with him in a very social manner, I retired to our camp for the night's repose. The Cheswat contains about two hundred and fifty houses, or rather huts, inhabited by Christians, They have no church, but are obliged to go to a town, about the distance of six miles, to hear divine service.

A little after four in the morning of the 16th we left that place, and having crossed a part of the Mount Rhodopus we entered a village called Cay alee, situated in the western plains, which lie between this mountain and that of the mount Hemous, and which are watered hy the river Ma- litza. These plains extend to the westward as far as the Macedonian mountains, which is a hundred miles in length, and about twenty in breadth. As we descended this mountain, the plains afforded a delightful and extensive prospect,"}, {"page_label": "Seite 244", "page_text": "( 189 ) prospect, which, together with the declivity of the mount Hemous, formed a very pleasing variety. On one hand, villages dispersed over the country ; on the other, well-cultivated land covered with ripe corn, and interspersed with infinite numbers of oak, and other kinds of trees. Our stay at Cayalee was only while we purchased some provisions. At nine in the forenoon we crolled a river, and left a village called Chardak-kioyou, containing about sixty or seventy huts, on the left hand. Having crested a second river, we arrived at a village called Yegni Mahallai, which contains about a hundred and forty huts. Having dined here, we repaired to an adjacent field, where we put the horses to grafs. We departed from hence about four o'clock, and at six we came to the plains of Pappas Ovalcee, or the Priests' Plains ; and in less than an hour after we arrived at Pappas, or the Priests' village, where we stopped to rest ourselves and our horses.

The court yard is twenty-sive feet square. It has two gates, one on the east, the other on the west. The village contains about sixty houses and huts, inhabited by Turks and Gipsies, together with a few Bulgarians. Soon after seven we proceeded to the plains of Philippopolis, and in about two hours after we came to the banks of the Maritsii, where we discovered a fountain ; and then, for about half, we travelled, with the river on our right hand, and the plains on the left ; soon after which we lost sight of the river : from this place we directed our way north ; and a short time after, having left the river, we stopped in a field for the night's repose. From the above-mentioned fountain all the plains belong to Philippopolis. The 17th, at four in the morning, we set off, and, as I advanced, I arrived at this city before the rest; and having viewed the greatest part of the town, I fat down to write you this epistle."}, {"page_label": "Seite 246", "page_text": "( l9t ) The situation of this city is pleasant, and charms by the singularity of its appearance. One would think that Nature, desirous of displaying the power of her lkill, had collected all the stones from the eastern and western plains, and made a heap of them in the middle of this ; for, during the whole of our descent from the mountains, which I have before mentioned, into the plains of Pappas and Phi- lippopolis, not the least appearance of a rock or stone was to be met with. The mountain in which this town is built extends from north to south for about three or four miles. It is divided into three heads ; the northern, which is the lowest, is watered by the river Maritsa ; the town begins at this part, and extends as far as the declivity of the second, silling the valley formed by those two heads for about two miles, from east to west.

We departed from Philippopolis, about half past three in the afternoon, and having passed the afore-mentioned wooden bridge, we left the river, the Macedonian mountains, and the western plains, which form so delightful a prospect on our left hand : on our right hand were the northern plains, which are very extensive, and sowed with different kinds of corn, some of which was cut down, and some standing': the fields nearer to the river were sowed with rice, and the whole interspersed with trees of different kinds, make the country bear an agreeable aspect,. 1 Having"}, {"page_label": "Seite 250", "page_text": "C 195 ) Having advanced, as was our custom, before our caravan, I observed at a distance several heaps of earth, raised up in the form of sugar- loaves, and dispersed in different parts of the plains.

This town is situated in the midst of a plain country; on the northwest is the river Maritia, and at the extremities of the plains towards the north, is the mountain Hemous ; and on the west and south, those of Macedonia. It is inhabited by Turks, Greeks, and Bulgarians, and it contains about three thousand houses. Most of the iron which comes fromSamacove, a'province of Macedonia, is sent here, and from hence to different markets of Thrace. There are sometimes found here old coins; but the people, fearful of offending government, melt them down : I purchased a few brass ones,"}, {"page_label": "Seite 252", "page_text": "( J 97 ) ones, most of which have Greek inscriptions. The markets are well supplied with all kinds of commodities, and the hans are seldom empty of merchants. The produce of this country does not consist in iron only, there is likewise a manufactury for yellow leather or morocco. The rice of this country is better and in greater quantity than at Philippopolis. Pro- vsions of all forts are cheap; there is great plenty of fish, with which they are supplied by the river. The Greeks have here two churches ; the Turks, too, have their mosques, but none of them are worthy of notice. The houses are built of bricks, and the streets are tolerably well paved, and of a good breadth. We left this town about four o'clock in the afternoon, and having rode for four miles, we crossed a small river which falls into the Maritsa, near Basargic ; having travelled till seven, we halted for our night's repose in a field not far from the O 3 banks"}, {"page_label": "Seite 253", "page_text": "(i93) banks of theMaritsa, where our rest proved very disagreeable, as it rained the greatest part of the night.

The situation of this village is very pleasant, and formed in such a manner as to afford a little garden, with fruit trees, to almost every house or cottage, to. gether with pasturage for their cattle.

From this place, in the time of the Christian emperors of Constantinople, there was a thick wall, extending across the mountain, in order to guard against the ravages of the Bulgarians ; but now almost the whole is demolished, except some few remains which are still discovered in the middle, of about twenty feet in height, and thirty feet thick.

Almost all the inhabitants are in a very miserable situation on account of these disputes.

The circumference of the city I judge to be now nearly three miles, as I had the curiosity to walk all round the ramparts, which I performed in less than an hour. The streets though irregular, are well paved, but have no curb for a foot path. There are two oblong squares, round which are tradesmen's shops of different kinds ; in the one is a fountain, and in the other a pyramidal pile, with several figures on it. On the north west of this, is a regu- 1 lar"}, {"page_label": "Seite 332", "page_text": "\\ ( 3 ) lar square somewhat larger than the others, in which are some fine houses, and no shops whatever; besides these, there are two other squares, less than the former.

The Custom house, likewise, which was formerly a monastery, is now changed into a noble and very commodious building. The buildings of the Imperial palace are likewise much increased, and a new theatre is added to the east of it, for the French and German drama.

The streets, though lighted at night, are dark in comparison of those in London ; that city, it is no more than just to fay, claims the preference of all other capitals in the universe ; in this point alone, of the regularity, the paving, and the lights of the streets, it must be acknowledged superior to all others ; for I can asture you that in all my travels I never saw a city that could equal her, though there are many which have, in some degree, finer buildings and gardens, yet they are destitute of that regularity and uniformity which form the chief beauty of a city.

Such a singular demand induced me to alk what benefit I was to derive from the number of tickets which I might receive during the course of the day, if my occupations led me often through the bar; but all the answer I could obtain from the man was, that he only obeyed orders without knowing any other reason.

A tower is built on these rocks, which is guarded by a number of invalid soldiers, who receive pay from the Bishop of Mentz. Every boat or vestel which pastes here pays a toll to the town of Paharack, which is opposite the tower, and which belongs to the Elector Palatine ; it seems to be an old town, of about a mile and half in circumference, and 1 unrounded by a stone wall.

The construction of them, which is very ingenious, and much admired by all that fee them; is as follows: --Two vessels, of about thirty tons burthen each, are joined together, over which is placed a floor of planks, railed all rounds except two places, one on each side, which are left open for the passengers, their goods and carriages, to come on and go off.

By this contrivance the motion of the bridge is regulated, and it is prevented from being carried down the river by the rapidity of the stream, in order to conduct it from one side to the other ; the masters make use of no other instrument than the rudders of the two vessels, by which means it approaches each bank, which is exactly level with the entrance of the bridge.

I begin, therefore, according to my promise, from Joppa, though I have already described its situation in the history of Abbey : but as Mr. Volney differs from me, I will convince him that my long residence in that part of the world enabled me to make juster observations by my own sight than he, by hearsay only.

There is only three palm trees in all the territory of Joppa, which are distant to the east about a mile. I saw these trees first in the year 1753, 1 756, l763, and from 1772 to r 773, in which time I left that place. The Plantation of olive trees begins near two miles distant eastward of Joppa, and continues as far as Rama. \" The only running water near this place is a river of about two miles distant to the north east, winch discharges itself into the sea,"}, {"page_label": "Seite 407", "page_text": "( 73 ) sea, at a rather greater distance to the north of Joppa. The gardens were not destroyed by the Mamlucks, as Mr. Volney fays, for they had strid orders from Abbey not to cut even a branch from a fruit tree ; but after he was told, that the besieged sallied out in the night, and began to cut the trees, and make use of them for fuel, he then gave orders to deprive them of that benefit; and accordingly most part of them were cut down in the month of December 1772. If Mr. Volney has really been at Joppa, as he is superior to me in the Latin language, and more curious than I was then, he should inform the public of the Latin inscription over the gate of the citadel, and on the guns which lay on the ground near it; perhaps his curiosity was at that time employed in some Arabic invention.

The windmills at Rama, which are two in number, one to the north east, and the other to the east of the town, which, in my time, were not in motion, were built by a Greek, and not by a Venetian, longtime before the town was surrendered to Abudahap ; they are not the only ones in Palestine and Syria, as Mr. Volney fays ; for, besides these, there are two at Soor, or Tyrous, and one six miles north of Acri, on a small hill, on which is the village I described in Abbey's History, which was pub- listied in the year 1783.

In 1753 the road to Jerusalem was, from Rama towards the east, crossing the mountains of Palestine straight, and descending into the valley of Hamma, or Hammaous ; but in the year 1756 the chiefs of the southern Arabs, who inhabited this part of the mountains, demanded more money than usual from the convents of the different persuasions, and not obtaining it, obstructed the road ; therefore the convents were obliged to change it, and made an agreement with the northern tribes to form a new road from Lidda. So the road now to Jerusalem is from that place, and is defended by the same tribes.

All these aromatic trees and plants grow wild without any cultivation. The Arabs collect great quantities of these roses, which they fell to the different convents ; from them is extracted the best rose water in all Turky, which is exported ; from hence is a very easy ascent to the aforesaid mountain.

Two of these native patriarchs having ended their lives in this century, the third, by name Abdallah, was chosen ; and having no other resource, he let the convent of Saint James the Zebedy to the Armenians for two hundred ducats per annum ; he let likewise that of Saint John the Evangelist to the Romish Friars at the same price, and condition ; both which convents were afterwards claimed by these nations at the Porte, proving with false witnesses and bribery, that they had purchased them, and by these means became possessors of them, and hold them to this day; however, in the year 1578, a clergyman, of a pious life, a native of Pelopo- nesus, or Morea, of the name of Germa- s nus,"}, {"page_label": "Seite 540", "page_text": "( 211 ) nus, came to the Holy Land with some pilgrims to visit the holy places out of devotion ; but finding the patriarch and the church in that dismal situation, offered his services to him, not only of his own fortune, but even wrote letters to many of his countrymen, and to the bishops, to raise a contribution among themselves, and fend assistance for the support of the Holy See.

During their stay in the Patriarch's college, they are treated by the vicar here: those amongst them who are disposed to bestow any charity for the support of the Holy See, are called into the council room, and subscribe : in general each of them give from fifty to two hundred dollars. This money, and that which the collectors of the Patriarch, who are sent by him for this purpose 2 into"}, {"page_label": "Seite 569", "page_text": "( 240 ) Into foreign dioceses, had acquired for the space of six years, is appropriated to defray the fees of the Porte, of the chiefs of the Holy Land, to pay the Arabs, for repairing the buildings which belong to the said fee, for paying the interest of the debt, and for the maintenance of the collegiate society, and the poor of Jerusalem ; which annual expences are computed to be eighty thousand dollars, and sometimes amounts to 100,000. The annual income is from seventy to seventy eight, and very seldom to eighty thousand. After they have done with their subscription, the vicar sends an order to Mutevelee, and to the key- keeper, to come and open the door of the church of the Resurrection, into which they are conducted by the steward of the pilgrims, who is appointed by the vicar to conduct them into all the different places during their stay in the Holy Land, who is one of the collegiate priests.

All these being prepared on Palm Sunday, after prayers and divine service is performed in the church of the Resurrection, the pilgrims being entertained with a dinner in the Patriarch's college according to the custom, (for at all the religious duties which are performed in the above said church, the pilgrims are always entertained by the vicar in the Patriarch's"}, {"page_label": "Seite 574", "page_text": "( 2, 45 ) triarch's college,) they are accompanied by the governor to the plains aforesaid, where they take Ihelter in the tents prepared for them.

On the following Monday the pilgrims, guarded by the troops, visit all the places which I have described 'in this part of the country. On Tuesday they go to the river near the ruins of Saint Gerasimus's convent, in which part the river is rather shallow ; the banks on both sides are stocked with trees close to each other, being in a serpentine form ; the men go in one place, and the women in at another.

During the time of their stay on the banks of the river, which is three or four hours, every one of them, out of devotion, cuts a stick from the trees which grow there, and carry it with them into their country. After having staid their usual time, those who are inclined to fee the Dead See, and places adjacent to it, which is distant about three miles towards the south west, make a compliment of a dollar or two each to the governor, for which they obtain his leave, and are accompanied by some of his troops : they then return to their tents, where they remain until the next day (Wednesday). About eight o'clock in the morning the governor takes the pilgrims under his guard, and leaves some of his men behind to accompany the Monks and the tents.

This contribution is called by the Arabs caphar. The whole expences of a pilgrim, that he is obliged to pay to the Turkish government as soon as he is landed at Joppa, are the following: Seven dollars and an half in that place, four and an half at Rama, seven and an half at Jerusalem, two in going to Bethlehem, and four and an half for the escort to the river Jordan. At the three first- mentioned places the caphar is the lame on leaving the Holy Land as that in coming; which sum altogether amounts to fifty-nine dollars and an half, Turkish money, which is in sterling five pounds nineteen shillings.
